Laptev, the former Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.", "3.  On 11 January 2006 the Court decided to communicate the complaint concerning the domestic courts’ failure to examine the applicant’s claim about his alleged infection with tuberculosis to the Government.

Upon arrival at the police station the applicant and Sh. admitted the charges. The applicant told the police the location of the garage they had robbed. It appears from the records of the applicant’s arrest and first questioning that his right to have legal assistance provided by the state or of his own choosing was explained to him. However, he declined the offer initially and said that he would appoint a counsel to defend him during the trial.", "7.  On 1 November 1996 the applicant was remanded in custody.", "8.  On 28 February 1997 the prosecution authorities referred the criminal case to the Vorkuta Town Court of the  (“the ”) for trial.", "9.  On 9 December 1997 the  found that during the pre-trial investigation the applicant had been deprived of an opportunity to appoint legal counsel of his own choosing. In the ’s view, the applicant’s defence rights had not been respected and the charges against him had been based to a large extent on his self-incriminating testimony. Furthermore, the  established that the applicant had been in custody for a year and that he had contracted tuberculosis. In those circumstances it decided to release the applicant on the undertaking not to leave his place of residence, and returned the case to the prosecution authorities for further investigation. The  ordered that all investigative measures, including questioning the applicant, should be conducted in the presence of the applicant’s legal counsel.", "10.  In July 1998 the investigating authorities discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant in the absence of any corpus delicti.

The applicant was represented by K., a counsel appointed by him. The applicant and Sh. denied all charges. They submitted that they had confessed to theft to protect Sh.’s brother.

Each time his refusal had been noted in the records of questioning and endorsed by the applicant. The  held that the applicant had admitted the charges and that other evidence examined in the trial proved his guilt. It dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant’s complaint that he had been questioned on occasion with no counsel present, finding that according to the records of questioning sessions signed by the applicant, he had declined to call a lawyer.", "13.  On the same date the  convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment, but ordered the sentence to be lifted under the Amnesty Act of 26 May 2000.

The Court considers that this complaint falls to be examined under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The relevant parts of this provision read as follows:", "“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal...”", "A.  Admissibility", "21.  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "22.  The Government acknowledged that the applicant’s right of access to a court had been violated as a result of the domestic courts’ failure to examine his claim concerning his alleged infection with tuberculosis while in pre-trial detention.", "23.  The applicant maintained his complaint.", "24.  The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way that provision embodies the \"right to a court\", of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, § 36). However, the right of access to a court does not consist only of a right to institute proceedings, but also of a right to obtain a “determination” of the dispute, or, in other words, to have the claims examined, by a court (see, mutatis mutandis, Multiplex v. , no. 58112/00, § 45, 10 July 2003).", "25.  The Court observes that on 22 December 1998 the applicant brought a claim against the Ministry of Finance before the Vorkuta Town Court of the , seeking compensation for his allegedly unlawful detention but also for having contracted tuberculosis in pre-trial detention. The applicant submitted several medical certificates in support of his claims relating to the alleged infection with tuberculosis. The Court notes that the applicant’s claims for compensation were undoubtedly “civil” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, and had a basis in national law.", "26.  It follows from the judgment of 23 January 2003, that the  examined only the applicant’s claims relating to compensation for detention and failed to examine his claim concerning his alleged infection with tuberculosis. The appellate instance, in its turn, endorsed the firstinstance court’s findings in summary fashion. It is therefore clear that the applicant’s claims regarding compensation for his alleged infection with tuberculosis remained without examination. Against this background and taking into account that the Government acknowledged the domestic courts’ failure to examine the applicant’s claim, the Court considers that the applicant was denied access to a court.", "27.  Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on that account.", "II.  OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION", "28.  The applicant complained under Article 3 that he had been infected with tuberculosis while in pre-trial detention. The Court recalls that, in accordance with the general rules of international law, the provisions of the Convention do not bind a Contracting Party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the Convention with respect to that Party (see, for example, Blečić v. Croatia [GC], no. 59532/00, § 70, 8 March 2006). The Court observes that the applicant was detained from 30 October 1996 to 9 December 1997, whereas the Convention entered into force in respect of the  on 5 May 1998. It follows that this complaint is incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.", "29.  The applicant further complained, under Article 5 § 5, that the domestic courts had dismissed his claim for damages for his allegedly unjustified detention. The Court notes that the right to compensation set forth in paragraph 5 presupposes that a violation of one of the preceding paragraphs of Article 5 has been established, either by a domestic authority or by the Court (see, for example, Stoichkov v. Bulgaria, no. 9808/02, § 72, 24 March 2005). In the present case the domestic courts have not established that the applicant’s detention from 30 October 1996 to 9 December 1997 was unlawful. The Court itself is not competent to examine the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention as it took place before 5 May 1998, the date of entry into force of the Convention in respect of the . Therefore, the applicant’s complaint under Article 5 § 5 is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.", "30.  The applicant also complained, under Article 6 § 3, that in the criminal proceedings against him he had not been assisted by a lawyer during the first questioning by police and he had been forced to incriminate himself. The Court notes that on 9 December 1997 the  returned the case for further investigation on the ground that the applicant’s right to defence had not been respected, and a new investigation had been conducted, respecting the applicant’s rights. Furthermore, the domestic courts established that the applicant had been assisted by a lawyer throughout the proceedings, except in those instances when he had explicitly declined to call him. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.", "31.  The applicant complained that the domestic courts had violated his rights under Article 8 of the Convention when they applied the Amnesty Act without him asking them to do so. The Court considers that this complaint does not disclose any appearance of a violation of Article 8. Finally, the applicant complained under Article 13 that the authorities had infringed his right to an effective remedy. The Court considers that the applicant failed to substantiate that complaint. Moreover, in so far as he relied on the fact that the domestic courts had not properly examined his complaints (see paragraph 20 above), the Court considers that this is covered by its findings under Article 6 of the Convention. In these circumstances the Court finds that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.", "III.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "32.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "33.  The applicant claimed 200,000 euros (EUR) in compensation for his alleged infection with tuberculosis. He further claimed 150,000  dollars in respect of just satisfaction for all the alleged violations of the Convention.", "34.  The Government considered that the amounts claimed were excessive and unsubstantiated. They submitted that if the Court were to find a violation in the present case, that in itself would constitute sufficient just satisfaction for any damage sustained by the applicant.", "35.  As regards the applicant’s claim for compensation for his alleged infection with tuberculosis, the Court notes that this issue were not subject to examination on the merits in the present case, and therefore rejects this claim. Furthermore, the Court considers that an award for just satisfaction in the present case must be based on the fact that the applicant did not have the benefit of the right of access to a court. However, the Court cannot speculate as to what would have been the final outcome of the proceedings (see, for example, Freitag v. Germany, no. 71440/01, § 64, 19 July 2007). It accordingly rejects the applicant’s claim in so far as it relates to pecuniary damage. On the other hand, the Court considers that the applicant has suffered distress and frustration as a result of the domestic courts’ failure to examine his claim about his alleged infection with tuberculosis, and that this cannot be sufficiently compensated for by the finding of a violation. Making its assessment on an equitable basis and having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court awards the applicant EUR 2,000 in respect of nonpecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "36.  The applicant did not make any claims in respect of the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and before the Court. Accordingly, the Court does not award anything under this head.", "C.  Default interest", "37.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Declares the complaint concerning lack of access to a court admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the applicant’s right of access to a court;", "", "3.  Holds", "(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into Russian roubles at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "4.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 15 May 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tAndré Wampach\tChristos Rozakis\n\tDeputy Registrar\tPresident"]}
