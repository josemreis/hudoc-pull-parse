He is currently detained in the Internment Facility at the US Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in . The applicant is represented before the Court by Mr J.A. Goldston, attorney, member of the New York Bar and Executive Director of the Open Society Justice Initiative (“the OSJI”), Mr R. Skilbeck, barrister, member of the England and Wales Bar and Litigation Director of the OSJI, Ms A. Singh, attorney, member of the New York Bar and Senior Legal Officer at the OSJI, and also by Ms N. Hollander, attorney, member of the New Mexico Bar.", "A.  Background", "1.  USS Cole bombing in 2000", "2.  On 12 October 2000 a suicide terrorist attack on the United States Navy destroyer USS Cole took place in Aden, Yemen when the ship stopped in the  harbour for refuelling. It was attacked by a small bomb-laden boat. The explosion opened a 40 foot hole in the warship, killing 17 American sailors and injuring 40 personnel.", "The applicant, considered to have been one of the most senior figures in al’Qaeda, has been the prime suspect in the 2000 bombing. He has been suspected of masterminding and orchestrating the attack (see also paragraph 55 below).", "2.  MV Limburg bombing", "3.  On 6 October 2002 a French oil tanker MV Limburg, while it was in the Gulf of Aden some miles offshore, was rammed by a small explosives-laden boat which detonated. The tanker caught fire and approximately 90,000 barrels (14,000 m3) of oil leaked into the Gulf of Aden. One crew member was killed and twelve others injured. The style of the attack resembled the suicide USS Cole bombing described above. The applicant has been suspected of playing a role in the attack (see also paragraph 55 below)", "3.  The so-called “High Value Detainees Programme”", "4.  After 11 September 2001 the US Government began operating a special interrogation and detention programme designated for suspected terrorists. On 17 September 2001 President Bush signed a classified Presidential Finding granting the Central Intelligence Agency (“the CIA”) extended competences relating to its covert actions, in particular authority to detain terrorist suspects and to set up secret detention facilities outside the , in cooperation with the governments of the countries concerned.", "5.  On an unspecified later date the CIA established a programme in the  to detain and interrogate terrorists at sites abroad. In further documents the American authorities referred to it as “the CTC program” (see also paragraphs 6-9 below) but, subsequently, it was also called “the High-Value Detainees Program” (“the HVD Programme”) (see also paragraph 8 below), or the Rendition Detention Interrogation Program (“the RDI Program”). In the Council of Europe’s documents it is also described as “the CIA secret detention programme” or “the extraordinary rendition programme” (see also paragraphs 66-82 below). For the purposes of the present case, it is referred to as “the HVD Programme”.", "6.  On 24 August 2009 the American authorities released a report prepared by John Helgerson, the CIA inspector general, in 2004 (“the 2004 CIA Report”). The document, dated 7 May 2004 and entitled “Special Review Counterterrorism Detention and Interrogation Activities September 2001-October 2003”, with appendices A-F, had previously been classified as “top secret”. It was considerably redacted; on the whole more than one-third of the 109-page document was blackened out.", "7.  The report starts from a statement that in November 2002 the CIA Deputy Director for Operations (“the DDO”) informed the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) that the Agency had established a programme in the Counterterrorist Centre (“CTC”) to detain and interrogate terrorists at sites abroad. It continues as follows:", "“He also informed OIG that he had just learned of and dispatched a team to investigate [REDACTED] In January 2003, the DDO informed OIG that he had received allegations that Agency personnel had used unauthorised interrogation techniques with a detainee, Abd Al-Rahim Al-Nashiri, at another foreign site, and requested that OIG investigate. Separately, OIG received information that some employees were concerned that certain covert Agency activities at an overseas detention and interrogation site might involve violations of human rights. In January 2003, OIG initiated a review of the Agency counter-terrorism detention and interrogation activities [REDACTED] and the incident with Al-Nashiri.”", "8.  The background of that programme was explained in paragraphs 4-5 as follows:", "“4.  [REDACTED] the Agency began to detain and interrogate directly a number of suspected terrorists. The capture and initial Agency interrogation of the first high value detainee, Abu Zubaydah, in March 2002, presented the Agency with a significant dilemma. The Agency was under pressure to do everything possible to prevent additional terrorist attacks. Senior Agency officials believed Abu Zubaydah was withholding information that could not be obtained through then-authorized interrogation techniques. Agency officials believed that a more robust approach was necessary to elicit threat information from Abu Zubaydah and possibly from other senior Al’Qaeda high value detainees.", "5.   [REDACTED] The conduct of detention and interrogation activities presented new challenges for CIA. These included determining where detention and interrogation facilities could be securely located and operated, and identifying and preparing qualified personnel to manage and carry out detention and interrogation activities. With the knowledge that Al’Qaeda personnel had been trained in the use of resistance techniques, another challenge was to identify interrogation techniques that Agency personnel could lawfully use to overcome the resistance. In this context, CTC, with the assistance of the Office of Technical Service (OTS), proposed certain more coercive physical techniques to use on Abu Zubaydah. All of these considerations took place against the backdrop of pre-September 11, 2001 CIA avoidance of interrogations and repeated  policy statements condemning torture and advocating the humane treatment of political prisoners and detainees in the international community.”", "9.  As explained in the 2004 CIA Report, “terrorist targets” and detainees referred to therein were generally categorised as “high value” or “medium value”. This distinction was based on the quality of intelligence that they were believed likely to be able to provide about current terrorist threats against the . “Medium Value Detainees” were individuals believed to have lesser direct knowledge of terrorist threats but to have information of intelligence value. “High Value Detainees” (also called “HVD”) were given the highest priority for capture, detention, and interrogation. In some CIA documents they are also referred to as “High Value Targets” (“HVT”).", "The applicant fell into this category.", "10.  In paragraph 6 of the report, in relation to the “legal parameters and constraints for interrogations” of suspected terrorists, it is stated that, following extensive consultations with the US Department of Justice and the National Security Council legal and policy staff, it was considered that “in most instances relevant to counter-terrorism detention and interrogation activities [redacted] the criminal prohibition against torture, ... is the controlling legal constraint on interrogations of detainees outside the United States”. It was further mentioned that in August 2002 the US Department of Justice had provided the CIA with a legal opinion determining that 10 specific “Enhanced Interrogation Techniques” (“the EITs”), as applied to suspected terrorists, would not violate the prohibition of torture. This document provided “the foundation for the policy and administrative decisions that guided the CTC Program”.", "11.  The EITs are described in paragraph 36 of the 2004 CIA Report as follows:", "“  [1.] The attention grasp consists of grasping the detainee with both hands, with one hand on each side of the collar opening, in a controlled and quick motion. In the same motion as the grasp, the detainee is drawn toward the interrogator.", "[2.] During the walling technique, the detainee is pulled forward and then quickly and firmly pushed into a flexible false wall so that his shoulder blades hit the wall. His head and neck are supported with a rolled towel to prevent whiplash.", "[3.] The facial hold is used to hold the detainee’s head immobile. The interrogator places an open palm on either side of the detainee’s face and the interrogator’s fingertips are kept well away from the detainee’s eyes.", "[4.] With the facial or insult slap, the fingers are slightly spread apart. The interrogator’s hand makes contact with the area between the tip of the detainee’s chin and the bottom of the corresponding earlobe.", "[5.] In cramped confinement, the detainee is placed in a confined space, typically a small or large box, which is usually dark. Confinement in the smaller space lasts no more than two hours and in the larger space it can last up to 18 hours.", "[6.] Insects placed in a confinement box involve placing a harmless insect in the box with the detainee.", "[7.] During wall standing, the detainee may stand about 4 to 5 feet from a wall with his feet spread approximately to his shoulder width. His arms are stretched out in front of him and his fingers rest on the wall to support all of his body weight. The detainee is not allowed to reposition his hands or feet.", "[8.] The application of stress positions may include having the detainee sit on file floor with his legs extended straight out in front of him with his anus raised above his head or kneeling on the floor while leaning back at a 45 degree angle.", "[9.] Sleep deprivation will not exceed 11 days at a time.", "[10.] The application of the waterboard technique involves binding the detainee to a bench with his feet elevated above his head. The detainee’s head is immobilized and an interrogator places a cloth over the detainee’s mouth and nose while pouring water onto the cloth in a controlled manner. Airflow is restricted for 20.to 40 seconds and the technique produces the sensation of drowning and suffocation.”", "12.  Appendix F to the 2004 CIA Report (Draft OMS Guidelines on Medical and Psychological Support to Detainee Interrogations of 4 September 2003) refers to “legally sanctioned interrogation techniques”. It states, among other things, that “captured terrorists turned over to the CIA for interrogation may be subjected to a wide range of legally sanctioned techniques. ... These are designed to psychologically ‘dislocate’ the detainee, maximize his feeling of vulnerability and helplessness, and reduce or eliminate his will to resist ... efforts to obtain critical intelligence”.", "The techniques included, in ascending degree of intensity:", "1)  Standard measures (i.e. without physical or substantial psychological pressure): shaving; stripping; diapering (generally for periods not greater than 72 hours); hooding; isolation; white noise or loud music (at a decibel level that will not damage hearing); continuous light or darkness; uncomfortably cool environment; restricted diet, including reduced caloric intake (sufficient to maintain general health); shackling in upright, sitting, or horizontal position; water dousing; sleep deprivation (up to 72- hours).", "2)  Enhanced measures (with physical or psychological pressure beyond the above): attention grasp; facial hold; insult (facial) slap; abdominal slap; prolonged diapering; sleep deprivation (over 72 hours); stress positions: on knees body slanted forward or backward or leaning with forehead on wall; walling; cramped confinement (confinement boxes) and waterboarding.", "13.  The CIA agents were authorised to use 4 standard interrogation techniques (sleep deprivation not exceeding 72 hours; continual use of light or darkness in a cell, loud music and white noise (background hum)) as indentified in November 2002 without the Headquarters’ prior approval. The use of the EITs required a prior approval (paragraph 89 of the 2004 CIA Report).", "14.  Appendix C to the 2004 CIA Report - Memorandum for John Rizzo Acting General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency of 1 August 2002 was prepared in connection with the application of the EITs to Abu Zubaydah, the first high-ranking Al’Qaeda prisoner who was to be subjected to those interrogation methods. It concludes that, given that “there is no specific intent to inflict severe mental pain or suffering ...the application “of these methods separately or a course of conduct” would not violate the prohibition of torture as defined in section 2340 of title 18 of the United States Code.", "15.  The CIA 2004 Report further states that, subsequently, the CIA Office of General Counsel (“OGC”) continued to consult with the US Department of Justice in order to expand the use of EITs beyond the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah. According to the report, “this resulted in the production of an undated and unsigned document entitled “Legal principles Applicable to CIA Detention and Interrogation of Captured Al’Qaeda Personnel”. The document is still classified as top secret. Certain parts are, however, rendered in the 2004 CIA report. For instance, the report states the following:", "“...the [Torture] Convention permits the use of [cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment] in exigent circumstances, such as a national emergency or war. ...the interrogation of Al’Qaeda members does not violate the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because those provisions do not apply extraterritorially, nor does it violate the Eighth Amendment because it only applies to persons upon whom criminal sanctions have been imposed ...", "The use of the following techniques and of comparable, approved techniques does not violate any Federal statute or other law, where the CIA interrogators do not specifically intend to cause the detainee to undergo severe physical or mental pain or suffering (i.e., they act with the good faith belief that their conduct will not cause such pain or suffering): isolation, reduced caloric intake (so long as the amount is calculated to maintain the general health of the detainees), deprivation of reading material} loud music or white noise (at a decibel level calculated to avoid damage to the detainees’ hearing), the attention grasp, walling, the facial hold, the facial slap (insult slap), the abdominal slap, cramped confinement, wall standing, stress positions, sleep deprivation, the use of diapers, the use of harmless insects, and the water board.”", "The report, in paragraph 44, states that according to OGC this analysis embodied the US Department of Justice agreement that the reasoning of the classified OLC opinion of 1 August 2002 extended beyond the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah and the conditions specified in that opinion.", "16.  As established in paragraph 51 of the report, in November 2002 CTC initiated training courses for CIA agents involved in interrogations. In January 2003 formal “Guidelines on Confinement Conditions for CIA Detainees” and “Guidelines on Interrogations Conducted Pursuant to [REDACTED]” were approved (paragraph 50).", "17.  The application of the EITs to other terrorist suspects in CIA custody, including the applicant in the present case, began in November 2002.", "18.  On 6 September 2006 President Bush delivered a speech announcing the closure of the HVD programme. According to information disseminated publicly by the US authorities, no persons were held by the CIA as of October 2006 and the detainees concerned were transferred to the custody of the US military authorities in the US Naval Base in .", "4.  Role of Jeppesen Company", "19.  Jeppesen Dataplan is a subsidiary of Boeing based in . According to the company’s website, it is an international flight operations service provider that coordinates everything from landing fees to hotel reservations for commercial and military clients.", "20.  In the light of reports on rendition flights (see paragraphs 99-102 below), a unit of the company Jeppesen International Trip Planning Service (JITPS) provided logistical support to the CIA for the renditions of persons suspected of terrorism.", "21.  In 2007, the American Civil Liberties Union (“the ACLU”) filed a federal lawsuit against Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc. on behalf of three extraordinary rendition victims with the District Court for the Northern District of California. Later, two other persons joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs. The suit charged that Jeppesen knowingly participated in these renditions by providing critical flight planning and logistical support services to aircraft and crews used by the CIA to forcibly disappear these five men to torture, detention and interrogation.", "In February 2008 the District Court dismissed the case on the basis of “state secret privilege”. In April 2009 the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the first-instance decision and remitted the case. In September 2010, on the US Government’s appeal, an 11-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of April 2009. In May 2011 the US Supreme Court refused the ACLU’s request to hear the lawsuit.", "B.  The circumstances of the case", "22.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.", "1.  The applicant’s capture, transfer to the CIA’s custody and his subsequent detention in Afghanistan and ", "23.   At the end of October 2002 the applicant was captured in Dubai, in the .", "24.  By November 2002, he was transferred to the custody of the CIA. This fact is mentioned in paragraph 7 of the 2004 CIA Report:", "“7.  [REDACTED] By November 2002, the Agency had Abu Zubaydah and another high-value detainee, Abd Al-Rahim Al Nashiri, in custody [REDACTED] and the Office of Medical Services (OMS) provided medical care to detainees.”", "25.  Subsequently, US agents took him to a secret CIA prison in  known as the “Salt Pit”. During his detention, the interrogators subjected him to prolonged stress standing positions, during which his wrists were shackled to a bar or hook in the ceiling above the head for at least two days.", "26.  After a brief stay at the “Salt Pit”, US agents took him to yet another secret CIA prison in , where he remained until 4 December 2002. The CIA subjected the applicant to the EITs (see also paragraphs 9-16 above) from November 2002 until 4 December 2002. In particular, during two separate interrogation sessions they subjected him to the so-called “waterboarding”.", "2.  Transfer to  and detention in the so-called “black site” in Stare Kiejkuty", "27.   The applicant submits that he was “rendered” to  under the HVD Programme on or about 5 December 2002.", "On 4 December 2002, the CIA transported the applicant on a chartered flight with tail number N63MU from Bangkok to a secret CIA detention site in . The flight flew from Bangkok via Dubai and landed in , on 5 December 2002 at 14h56. The flight was disguised under multiple layers of secrecy characterising flights that the CIA chartered to transport persons under the HVD programme (see also paragraphs 81-83 and 99-102 below).", "28.  The fact that the applicant was transferred to a secret detention site on 5 December 2002 and then tortured is confirmed in paragraph 224 of the of the 2004 CIA Report, which states:", "“224.  With respect to Al-Nashiri [REDACTED] reported two waterboard sessions in November 2002, after which psychologist/interrogators determined that Al-Nashiri was compliant. However, after being moved [REDACTED] Al-Nashiri was thought to be withholding information. Al-Nashiri subsequently received additional EITs, but not the waterboard. The Agency then determined Al-Nashiri to be ‘compliant’. Because of the litany of techniques used by different interrogators over a relatively short period of time, it is difficult to identify exactly why Al-Nashiri became more willing to provide information. However, following the use of EITs, he provided information about his most current operational planning and [REDACTED] as opposed to the historical information he provided before the use of EITs.”", "29.  The applicant, relying on official documents disclosed by the Polish Border Guard to the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, states that those documents confirm that Polish officials cleared flight N63MU for arrival at Szymany airport on 5 December 2002. In this connection, the applicant produced a letter from the Border Guard Office to the Helsinki Foundation dated 23 July 2010. The letter, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "“In relation to the letter ref/1614/2010/АВЛР and dated July 5, 2010, the letter ref 1345/2010/AB/IP and dated May 31, 2010, as well as the letter of the [Border] Guard ref ZG-2582/WliBD/lO and dated June 16, 2010 concerning the making available of information by the [Border] Guard detailing the borders clearance of the airplanes with registration numbers N63MU, N379P, N313P and N8213G at Szymany аirport in 2002 and 2005 after having obtained a statement from the Public Prosecutor’s Office assenting to the making available of the clearance information, I kindly inform that on the basis of archival documentation the [Border] Guard can confirm the clearance of the following аirplanes for takeoff and landing:", "N63MU, December 5, 2002.", "Arrival/ passengers:8, crew:4; Departure/ passengers: 0, crew: 4", "N379P, February 8, 2003", "Arrival/ passengers: 7, crew: 4; Departure/ passengers: 4, crew: 4", "N379P, March 7, 2003", "Arrival/ passengers: 2, crew: 2; Departure/ passengers:0, crew: 2", "N379P, March 25, 2003", "Arrival/ passengers: 1, crew:2; Departure/ passengers: 0, crew:2", "N379P, June 6,2003", "Arrival/passengers: 1, crew: 2; Departure/ passengers:0, crew:2", "N379P, July 30, 2003", "Arrival/passengers: 1, crew: 3; Departure/passengers: 0, crew: 3", "N313P, September 22, 2003", "Arrival/ passengers: 0, crew: 7; Departure/ passengers: 5, crew: 7", "We do not possess information that can confirm the border clearance of the airplane with registration number N8213G. ...”", "30.  The applicant further refers to a 2007 Council of Europe report (“the 2007 Marty report” – see also paragraphs 73-82 below), which identifies N63MU as a “rendition plane” that arrived in Szymany from  at 14h56 on 5 December 2002", "31.  The applicant was subjected to torture and inhuman and degrading treatment while he was held incommunicado in a secret prison on Polish territory.", "The 2004 CIA Report, in paragraphs 90-98, refers to the following events that took place in December 2002 and January 2003 when he was, as he alleges, held in :", "“Specific Unauthorized or Undocumented Techniques", "90.  [REDACTED] This Review heard allegations of the use of unauthorized techniques [REDACTED]. The most significant, the handgun and power drill incident, discussed below, is the subject of a separate OIG investigation. In addition, individuals interviewed during the Review identified other techniques that caused concern because DoJ had not specifically approved them. These included the making of threats, blowing cigar smoke, employing certain stress positions, the use of a stiff brush on a detainee, and stepping on a detainee’s ankle shackles. For all of the instances, the allegations were disputed or too ambiguous to reach any authoritative determination regarding the facts. Thus, although these allegations are illustrative of the nature of the concerns held by individuals associated with the CTC Program and the need for clear guidance, they did not warrant separate investigations or administrative action.", "Handgun and Power Drill", "91.  [REDACTED] interrogation team members, whose purpose was to interrogate-Al-Nashiri and debrief Abu Zubaydah initially staffed [REDACTED]. The interrogation team continued EITs on Al-Nashiri for two weeks in December 2002 [REDACTED] they assessed him to be ‘compliant’. Subsequently, CTE officers at Headquarters [REDACTED] sent a [REDACTED] senior operations officer (the debriefer) [REDACTED] to debrief and assess Al-Nashiri.", "92.  [REDACTED] The debriefer assessed AI-Nashiri as withholding information, at which point [REDACTED] reinstated [REDACTED] hooding, and handcuffing. Sometime between 28 December 2002 and 1 January 2003, the debriefer used an unloaded semi-automatic handgun as a prop to frighten Al-Nashiri into disclosing information. After discussing this plan with [REDACTED] the debriefer entered the cell where Al-Nashiri sat shackled and racked [racking is a mechanical procedure used with firearms to chamber a bullet or simulate a bullet being chambered] the handgun once or twice close to Al-Nashiri’s head. On what was probably the same day debriefer used a power drill to frighten Al-Nashiri. [REDACTED] consent, the debriefer entered the detainee’s cell and revved the drill while the detainee stood naked and hooded. The debriefer did not touch Al-Nashiri with the power drill.", "93.  The [REDACTED] and debriefer did not request authorization or report the use of these unauthorized techniques to Headquarters. However, in January 2003, newly arrived TDY officers [REDACTED] who had learned of these incidents reported them to Headquarters. OIG investigated and referred its findings to the Criminal Division of DoJ. On 11 September 2003, DoJ declined to prosecute and turned these matters over to CIA for disposition. These incidents are the subject of a separate OIG Report of Investigation.", "Threats", "94.  [REDACTED] During another incident [REDACTED} the same Headquarters debriefer, according to a [REDACTED] who was present, threatened Al-Nashiri by saying that if he did not talk, ‘We could get your mother here’ and, ‘We can bring your family in here’. The [REDACTED] debriefer reportedly wanted Al-Nashiri to infer, for psychological reasons, that the debriefer might be [REDACTED] intelligence officer based on his Arabic dialect and that Al-Nashiri was in [REDACTED] custody because it was widely believed in Middle East circles that [REDACTED] interrogation technique involves sexually abusing female relatives in front of the detainee. The debriefer denied threatening AI-Nashiri through his family. The debriefer also said he did not explain who he was or where he was from when talking with Al-Nashiri. The debriefer said he never said he was [REDACTED] intelligence officer but let AI-Nashiri draw his own conclusions.", "...", "Smoke", "96.  [REDACTED] An Agency [REDACTED] interrogator admitted that, in December 2002, he and another [REDACTED] smoked cigars and blew smoke in AlNashiri’s face during an interrogation. The interrogator claimed they did this to ‘cover the stench’ in the room and to help keep the interrogators alert late at night. This interrogator said he would not do this again based on ‘perceived criticism’. Another Agency interrogator admitted that he also smoked cigars during two sessions with Al-Nashiri to mask the stench in the room. He claimed he did not deliberately force smoke into Al-Nashiri’s face.", "Stress Positions", "97.  [REDACTED] OIG received reports that interrogation team members employed potentially injurious stress positions on Al-Nashiri. Al-Nashiri was required to kneel on the floor and lean back. On at least one occasion, an Agency officer reportedly pushed AI-Nashiri backward while he was in this stress position. On another occasion [REDACTED] said he had to intercede after [REDACTED] expressed concern that Al-Nashiri’s arms might be dislocated from his shoulders. [REDACTED] explained that, at the time, the interrogators were attempting to put Al-Nashiri in a standing stress position. Al-Nashiri was reportedly lifted off the floor by his arms while his arms were bound behind his back with a belt.", "Stiff Brush and Shackles", "98  [REDACTED] interrogator reported that he witnessed other techniques used on Al-Nashiri that the interrogator knew were not specifically approved by DoJ. These included the use of a stiff brush that was intended to induce pain on Al-Nashiri and standing on Al-Nashiri’s shackles, which resulted in cuts and bruises. When questioned, an interrogator who was at [REDACTED] acknowledged that they used a stiff brush to bathe Al-Nashiri. He described the brush as the kind of brush one uses in a bath to remove stubborn dirt. A CTC manager who had heard of the incident attributed the abrasions on Al-Nashiri’s ankles to an Agency officer accidentally stepping on Al-Nashiri’s shackles while repositioning him into a stress position.”", "32.  The use of the EITS on the applicant and his ill-treatment, in particular threats and subjection to prolonged stress positions at the relevant time (i.e. in his “third place of detention” which was allegedly Poland) is also described in the International Committee for the Red Cross (“the ICRC”) Report on the Treatment of Fourteen “High Value Detainees” in CIA Custody of February 2007 (“the 2007 ICRC Report”), based on interviews with the applicant and 13 other high-value detainees after they were transferred to Guantanamo Bay (for a detailed description see paragraphs 91-93 below).", "3.  Transfer to the  Gunatanamo Bay Naval Base", "33.  On or about 6 June 2003, Polish authorities assisted the CIA in secretly transferring the applicant from Poland to , on a rendition plane flight N379P.", "There was apparently no attempt by the Polish Government to seek diplomatic assurances from the United States to avert the risk of his being subjected to further torture, incommunicado detention, an unfair trial, or the death penalty when in the  custody.", "34.  The applicant submits that official documents released by the Polish Border Guard to the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights confirm that flight N379P was cleared for departure from Szymany airport on 6 June 2003 (see paragraph 29 above).", "In this connection, he also cites the 2007 Marty Report, which identifies flight N379P as a “rendition plane” that flew from  and landed in Szymany airport the previous day, i.e., on 5 June 2003 (see paragraphs 74-82 below).", "35.  He further adds that the flight data procured by the 2007 Marty Report was subsequently analysed by the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice (“the CHRGJ”), which, in its report released on 9 March 2010 (“the CHRGJ Report”), confirmed that N379P’s movements over 37 June 2003 “conform to the most typical attributes of a CIA rendition circuit”. The data collected and examined in the CHRGJ Report shows that a Gulfstream V aircraft, registered with the US Federal Aviation Administration as N379P, embarked from Dulles Airport, Washington D.C. on Tuesday June 3, at 23 h33m GMT and undertook a four-day flight circuit, during which it landed in and departed from six different foreign countries including Germany, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Poland, Morocco and Portugal. The aircraft returned from  back to Dulles Αirport on 7 June 2003 (for further details (see also paragraphs 99-102 below).", "36.  The applicant, relying on the CHRGJ flight data analysis, states that it confirms that the Polish Government granted licences and overflight permissions to facilitate the CIA rendition flight N379P and that the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency (PANSA) (Polska Agencja Żeglugi Powietrznej) officials collaborated with Jeppesen (and, by extension, with Jeppesen’s client, the CIA) by accepting the task of navigating this disguised flight into Szymany. Indeeed, they knowingly issued a permit for , despite the fact that they knew that the aircraft was actually going to land in Szymany (for further details see paragraphs 81-82 and 99-102 below).", "4.  The applicant’s further transfers during CIA custody", "37.  After his transfer out of Poland, the applicant was detained in Rabat, Morocco, until 22 September 2003, when he was flown to the US Naval Base in .", "38.  On 27 March 2004 the CIA flew the applicant from Guantanamo Bay back to .", "39.  Subsequently, he was moved to the CIA secret detention facility in Bucharest, Romania, and remained there until he was finally transferred to .", "5.  The applicant’s detention in  and his trial before the Military Commission", "40.  On 6 September 2006 President Bush publicly acknowledged that 14 “high value detainees”, including the applicant, had been transferred from the HVD Programme run by the CIA to the custody of the Department of Defense in the Guantanamo Bay Internment Facility (see also paragraph 18 above).", "41.  Since an unspecified date, presumably in September 2006, the applicant has been detained in the US Naval Base in . By that time, he had already been held in undisclosed detention for nearly 4 years.", "42.  On 14 March 2007 the applicant was heard by the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, which purported to review all the information related to the question whether he met the criteria to be designated as an “enemy combatant” (i.e. an individual who was part of or supporting Taliban or Al’Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including one who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid of enemy armed forces). The hearing was closed to the public. The applicant was not afforded legal counsel at this hearing. A “personal representative” was appointed for him, but this person did not act as counsel and the applicant’s statements to this representative were not privileged. He did not have access to any classified evidence that was introduced against him. Nor did he have the right to confront any of the accusations that were introduced at this hearing.", "43.  According to a partially redacted transcript of that hearing, the applicant stated that he “[had been] tortured into confession and once he [had] made a confession his captors [had been] happy and they [had] stopped torturing him. He also stated that he had made up stories during the torture in order to get it to stop and that “[f]rom the time I [had been] arrested five years ago, they [had] been torturing me. It [had] happened during interviews. One time they [had] tortured me one way and another time they [had] tortured me in a different way”. The applicant’s reply to the President of the Tribunal’s request to describe the methods that were used, is largely redacted from the transcript of the hearing. The unredacted portion however states that: “before I was arrested I used to be able to run about ten kilometres. Now, I cannot walk for more than ten minutes. My nerves are swollen in my body”.

Moreover, the military judge ordered that a hearing on the defence motion regarding the applicant’s transportation be held immediately after the arraignment. In response to this order, the defence filed a notice that it intended to introduce evidence of how he was treated while in CIA custody.", "Hours after this notice was filed, on 5 February 2009, the US Government officially withdrew charges from the military commission, thus removing the applicant’s case from the military judge’s jurisdiction.", "51.  Military commission rules applicable to the applicant have changed since the time he was transferred from  and are now governed by the Military Commission Act of 2009, which was enacted on 28 October 2009.

Military commissions still apply only to non-US citizens. The current rules place no limits on the length of time within which a suspect must be charged or tried. Indeed, they expressly exempt military commissions from speedy trial requirements. Furthermore, the current military commission rules allow for the accused to be denied access to classified information or evidence and, unlike US federal court procedures which bar the admission of hearsay, they expressly permit hearsay evidence and do not bar convictions based mainly on such evidence.", "53.  The applicant submits that, given the widespread torture and abuse of US terrorism suspects, whose statements could be introduced as hearsay evidence against him, he is in consequence unable to confront witnesses against him. Unlike  federal court procedures which bar the admission of evidence derived from coerced statements, the current military commission rules admit evidence derived from coerced statements if that evidence would have been otherwise obtained and the use of such evidence would be consistent with the interests of justice. Moreover, the military commissions will still be held in the remote location of , thereby significantly hindering public access to the proceedings against the applicant. Finally, there is considerable uncertainty associated with the current military commission rules, which were enacted as recently as October 2009 and have been applied so far in only three cases, none of which involved the death penalty.", "54.  In March 2011 President Obama announced that he would be lifting a 2-year freeze on new military trials for detainees at the US Naval Base in .", "55.  On 20 April 2011 United States military commission prosecutors brought capital charges against the applicant relating to his alleged role in the attack on the USS Cole in 2000 and the attack on the French civilian oil tanker MV Limburg in the Gulf of Aden in 2002. The charges against him included terrorism, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, hazarding a vessel, using treachery or perfidy, murder in violation of the law of war, attempted murder in violation of the law of war, conspiracy to commit terrorism and murder in violation of the law of war, destruction of property in violation of the law of war and attempted destruction of property in violation of the law of war. The applicant was designated for trial by military commission despite the fact that the United States Government had previously indicted two of his alleged co-conspirators in the USS Cole bombing – Jamal Ahmed Mohammed Al-Badawi and Fahd Al-Quso – in the  federal court. The relevant indictment, filed on 15 May 2003 while the applicant was secretly held in CIA custody in , identified him as an unindicted соconspirator in the USS Cole bombing.", "56.  The military commission prosecutors announced that the capital charges against the applicant would be forwarded for independent review to Bruce MacDonald, the “convening authority” for the military commissions, for decision whether to reject the charges or to refer some, all or none of them for trial before the military commission.", "57.  On 27 April 2011 Mr MacDonald informed the  military defence counsel for the applicant that he would accept written submissions against the death penalty until 30 June 2011. In the applicant’s view, this implied that he would shortly thereafter make a decision on whether capital charges should be referred to a specified military commission for trial.", "58.  The military commission hearing in the applicant’s case began on 17 January 2012.

The Washington Post subsequently admitted that it had been in possession of the names of the countries, but had refrained from naming them further to an agreement entered into with the authorities.

It has to be said that most governments did not seem particularly eager to establish the alleged facts. The body of information gathered makes it unlikely that European states were completely unaware of what, in the context of the fight against international terrorism, was happening at some of their airports, in their airspace or at American bases located on their territory. Insofar as they did not know, they did not want to know. It is inconceivable that certain operations conducted by American services could have taken place without the active participation, or at least the collusion, of national intelligence services. If this were the case, one would be justified in seriously questioning the effectiveness, and therefore the legitimacy, of such services. The main concern of some governments was clearly to avoid disturbing their relationships with the , a crucial partner and ally. Other governments apparently work on the assumption that any information learned via their intelligence services is not supposed to be known.”", "72.  In Chapter 8.2 concerning parliamentary investigations undertaken in certain member states, the report refers to Poland under the title “: a parliamentary inquiry, carried out in secret”:", "“252. A parliamentary inquiry into the allegations that a ‘secret prison’ exists in the country has been conducted behind closed doors in . Promises made beforehand notwithstanding, its work has never been made public, except at a press conference announcing that the inquiry had not found anything untoward.

It states, inter alia, the following:", "“280. Our analysis of the CIA rendition’ programme has revealed a network that resembles a ‘spider’s web’ spun across the globe. The analysis is based on official information provided by national and international air traffic control authorities, as well as other information including from sources inside intelligence agencies, in particular the American. This ‘web’, shown in the graphic, is composed of several landing points, which we have subdivided into different categories, and which are linked up among themselves by civilian planes used by the CIA or military aircraft.", "...", "282. In two European countries only (Romania and ), there are two other landing points that remain to be explained. Whilst these do not fall into any of the categories described above, several indications lead us to believe that they are likely to form part of the ‘rendition circuits’. These landings therefore do not form part of the 98% of CIA flights that are used solely for logistical purposes, but rather belong to the 2% of flights that concern us the most. These corroborated facts strengthen the presumption – already based on other elements – that these landings are detainee drop-off points that are near to secret detention centres.", "...", "287. Whilst hard evidence, at least according to the strict meaning of the word, is still not forthcoming, a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centres have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in Europe. I do not set myself up to act as a criminal court, because this would require evidence beyond reasonable doubt. My assessment rather reflects a conviction based upon careful examination of balance of probabilities, as well as upon logical deductions from clearly established facts. It is not intended to pronounce that the authorities of these countries are \"guilty\" for having tolerated secret detention sites, but rather it is to hold them \"responsible\" for failing to comply with the positive obligation to diligently investigate any serious allegation of fundamental rights violations.", "288.

At the explicit request of the American government, the Washington Post simply referred generically to ‘eastern European democracies’, although it was aware of the countries actually concerned. It should be noted that ABC did also name Poland and  in an item on its website, but their names were removed very quickly in circumstances which were explained in our previous report. We have also had clear and detailed confirmation from our own sources, in both the American intelligence services and the countries concerned, that the two countries did host secret detention centres under a special CIA programme established by the American administration in the aftermath of 11 September 2001 to “kill, capture and detain” terrorist suspects deemed to be of ‘high value’. Our findings are further corroborated by flight data of which , in particular, claims to be unaware and which we have been able to verify using various other documentary sources.", "8.  The secret detention facilities in Europe were run directly and exclusively by the CIA. To our knowledge, the local staff had no meaningful contact with the prisoners and performed purely logistical duties such as securing the outer perimeter. The local authorities were not supposed to be aware of the exact number or the identities of the prisoners who passed through the facilities – this was information they did not ‘need to know.’ While it is likely that very few people in the countries concerned, including in the governments themselves, knew of the existence of the centres, we have sufficient grounds to declare that the highest state authorities were aware of the CIA’s illegal activities on their territories.", "...", "10. In most cases, the acts took place with the requisite permissions, protections or active assistance of government agencies. We believe that the framework for such assistance was developed around NATO authorisations agreed on 4 October 2001, some of which are public and some of which remain secret. According to several concurring sources, these authorisations served as a platform for bilateral agreements, which – of course – also remain secret.", "11. In our view, the countries implicated in these programmes have failed in their duty to establish the truth: the evidence of the existence of violations of fundamental human rights is concrete, reliable and corroborative. At the very least, it is such as to require the authorities concerned at last to order proper independent and thorough inquiries and stop obstructing the efforts under way in judicial and parliamentary bodies to establish the truth. International organisations, in particular the Council of Europe, the European Union and NATO, must give serious consideration to ways of avoiding similar abuses in future and ensuring compliance with the formal and binding commitments which states have entered into in terms of the protection of human rights and human dignity.", "12. Without investigative powers or the necessary resources, our investigations were based solely on astute use of existing materials – for instance, the analysis of thousands of international flight records – and a network of sources established in numerous countries. With very modest means, we had to do real “intelligence” work. We were able to establish contacts with people who had worked or still worked for the relevant authorities, in particular intelligence agencies. We have never based our conclusions on single statements and we have only used information that is confirmed by other, totally independent sources. Where possible we have cross-checked our information both in the European countries concerned and on the other side of the Atlantic or through objective documents or data. Clearly, our individual sources were only willing to talk to us on the condition of absolute anonymity.

The US Government therefore had to seek means of forging intergovernmental partnerships with well-developed military components, rather than simply relying upon the existing liaison networks through which CIA agents had been working for decades.", "...", "83. Based upon my investigations, confirmed by multiple sources in the governmental and intelligence sectors of several countries, I consider that I can assert that the means to cater to the CIA’s key operational needs on a multilateral level were developed under the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).", "....”", "77.  In paragraphs 112-122 the 2007 Marty Report referred to bilateral agreements between the  and certain countries to host “black sites” for high value detainees. This part of the document reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "“112. Despite the importance of the multilateral NATO framework in creating the broad authorisation for US counter-terrorism operations, it is important to emphasise that the key arrangements for CIA clandestine operations in Europe were secured on a bilateral level.", "...", "115. The bilaterals at the top of this range are classified, highly guarded mandates for ‘deep’ forms of cooperation that afford – for example – ‘infrastructure’, ‘material support and / or ‘operational security’ to the CIA’s covert programmes. This high-end category has been described to us as the intelligence sector equivalent of ‘host nation’ defence agreements – whereby one country is conducting operations it perceives as being vital to its own national security on another country’s territory.", "116. The classified ‘host nation’ arrangements made to accommodate CIA ‘black sites’ in Council of Europe member states fall into the last of these categories.", "117. The CIA brokered ‘operating agreements’ with the Governments of Poland and  to hold its High-Value Detainees (HVDs) in secret detention facilities on their respective territories. Poland and  agreed to provide the premises in which these facilities were established, the highest degrees of physical security and secrecy, and steadfast guarantees of non-interference.", "118. We have not seen the text of any specific agreement that refers to the holding of High-Value Detainees in Poland or . Indeed it is practically impossible to lay eyes on the classified documents in question or read the precise agreed language because of the rigours of the security-of-information regime, itself kept secret, by which these materials are protected.", "119. However, we have spoken about the High-Value Detainee programme with multiple well-placed sources in the governments and intelligence services of several countries, including the United States, Poland and . Several of these persons occupied positions of direct involvement in and/ or influence over the negotiations that led to these bilateral arrangements being agreed upon. Several of them have knowledge at different levels of the operations of the HVD programme in Europe.", "120. These persons spoke to us upon strict assurances of confidentiality, extended to them under the terms of the special authorisation I received from my Committee last year. For this reason, in the interests of protecting my sources and preserving the integrity of my investigations, I will not divulge individual names. Yet I can state unambiguously that their testimonies - insofar as they corroborate and validate one another – count as credible, plausible and authoritative.”", "78.  Paragraphs 123-135 explain the US’s choice of European partners. This part of the report reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "“123. It is interesting to note that the United States chose, in the case of Poland and , to form special partnerships with countries that were economically vulnerable, emerging from difficult transitional periods in their history, and dependent on American support for their strategic development.", "124. In terms of both political and intelligence considerations, several sources confirmed that much of the Eastern European ‘bloc’ was considered ‘out of bounds’ for the CIA in contemplating sites for its covert HVD programme. A long-serving CIA officer shared the following analysis with us:", "‘In a lot of those counties, there is still a mindset formed during the Cold War that we are not always on their side. There is a certain tendency to be less than open to our advances. You have to remember most of the East Еuropean services are KGB services and that doesn’t change overnight.", "I think Poland is the main exception; we have an extraordinary relationship with . My experience is that if the Poles can help us they will. Whether it’s intelligence, or economics, or politics or diplomacy – they are our allies. I guess if there is a special relationship outside of the ‘four eyes’ group, then it is the Americans and the Poles.’", "125. In Poland’s case, a specific strategic incentive tied in with the NATO framework was the United States’ staunch support for the establishment in  of the lucrative ‘NATINADS’ programme - the NATO Integrated Air Defence System. Poland participated in the US-led military coalitions in both Afghanistan and Iraq, notably contributing significant Special Forces deployments to Operation Enduring Freedom, and later assuming control of one of the ‘zones’ of allied control in Iraq. An ongoing process of realignment and reform of intelligence structures is dedicated primarily to purging the secret services of so-called ‘communist remnants’.", "126. The United States negotiated its agreement with  to detain CIA High-Value Detainees on Polish territory in 2002 and early 2003. We have established that the first HVDs were transferred to  in the first half of 2003. In accordance with the operational arrangements described below, Poland housed what the CIA’s Counterterrorism Centre considered its ‘most sensitive HVDs’, a category which included several of the men whose transfer to  was announced by President Bush on 6 September 2006.”", "79.  Paragraphs 167-179 describe the cooperation between the  and Polish intelligence services. The relevant passages red as follows:", "“167. Since the May 2002 ‘quasi-reform’ of its secret services, Poland has had two civilian intelligence agencies the Internal Security Agency (Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnetrznego, or ABW); and the ... Intelligence Agency (Agencja Wywiadu, or AW) Neither of these services was considered a viable choice as a CIA partner for the sensitive operations of the HVD programme m Poland, precisely because they are ‘subject to civil supervision, both by Parliament and Government’. ...", "168. According to our sources, the CIA determined that the bilateral arrangements for operation of its HVD programme had to remain absolutely outside of the mechanisms of civilian oversight. For this reason the CIA’s chosen partner intelligence agency in  was the Military Information Services (Wojskowe Służby Informacyjne, or WSI), whose officials are part of the Polish Armed Forces and enjoy ‘military status in defence agreements under the NATO framework. The WSI was able to maintain far higher levels of secrecy than the two civilian agencies due to its recurring ability to emerge ‘virtually unscathed’ from post-Communism reform processes designed at achieving democratic oversight. ....", "170 From our interviews with current and former Polish military intelligence officials, we have established that the WSI’s role in the HVD programme comprised two levels of co-operation. On the first level, military intelligence officers provided extraordinary levels of physical security by setting up temporary or permanent military-style ‘buffer zones’ around the CIA’s detainee transfer and interrogation activities. This approach was deployed most notably to protect the CIA’s movements to and from, as well as its activities within, the military training base at Stare Kiejkuty. Classified documents, the existence of which was made known to our team describe how WSI agents performed these security role under the guise of a Polish Army Unit (Jednostka Wojskowa) denoted by the code JW-2669, which was the formal occupant of the Stare Kiejkuty facility.", "171 On the second level, the WSI’s assistance depended to a large extent on its covert penetration of other state and parastatal institutions through its collaboration with undercover ‘functionaries’ in their ranks. Our sources have indicated to us that WSI collaborators were present within institutions including the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency (Polska Agencja Żeglugi Powietrznej), where they assisted m disguising the existence and exact movements of incoming CIA flights; the Polish Border Guard (Straż Graniczna), where they ensured that normal procedures for incoming foreign passengers were not strictly applied when those CIA flights landed; and the national Customs Office (Główny Urząd Celny), where they resolved irregularities in the non-payment of fees related to CIA operations Thus the military intelligence partnership brought with it influence throughout a society-wide undercover community, none of which was checked by the conventional civilian oversight mechanisms.”", "80.  Paragraphs 174-179 contain conclusions as to who were the Polish State officials responsible for authorising Poland’s role in the CIA’s HVD programme. They read, in their relevant part:", "“174. During several months of investigations, our team has held discussions with various Polish sources, including civilian and military intelligence operatives, representatives of state or municipal authorities, and high-ranking officials who hold first-hand knowledge of the operations of the HVD programme in . Based upon these discussions, which have come to the same conclusions, my inquiry allows me to state that some individual high office-holders knew about and authorised Poland’s role in the CIA’s operation of secret detention facilities for High-Value Detainees on Polish territory, from 2002 to 2005. The following persons could therefore be held accountable for these activities: the President of the , Aleksander KWAŚNIEWSKI, the Chief of the National Security Bureau (also Secretary of National Security Committee), Marek SIWIEC, the Minister of National Defence (Ministerial oversight of Military Intelligence), Jerzy SZMAJDZINSKI, and the Head of Military Intelligence, Marek DUKACZEWSKI.", "175. In my analysis the hierarchy for control of the Polish Military Information Services, or WSI, was chronically lacking in formal oversight and independent monitoring. As a result the structure described here from 2002 to 2005 depended to a great extent on close relationships of trust and professional familiarity, both among the Polish principals and between the Poles and their American counterparts. Several of our sources characterised the bonds between these four individuals as being a combination of loyal personal allegiance (‘we all serve one another’) and strong common notions of national duty (‘... but first we serve the Republic of Poland’).", "176. There was complete consensus on the part of our key senior sources that President Kwasniewski was the foremost national authority on the HVD programme. One military intelligence source told us: ‘Listen, Poland agreed from the top down... From the President - yes... to provide the CIA all it needed.’ Asked whether the Prime Minister and his Cabinet were briefed on the HVD programme, our source said: ‘Even the ABW [Internal Security Agency] and AW [Foreign Intelligence Agency] do not have access to all of our classified materials. Forget the Prime Minister it operated directly under the President’.", "177. Our investigations have revealed that the state office from which much of the strength of this Polish accountability structure derived was the National Security Bureau (Biuro Bezpieczeństwa Narodowego, or BBN), located in the Chancellery of President Kwasniewski. Our sources confirmed to us that the bilateral operational arrangements for the HVD programme in  were ‘negotiated on the part of the President’s office by the National Security Bureau [BBN]’.", "178. Marek Dukaczewski, an outstanding military intelligence officer ultimately promoted to the rank of General, served the BBN in the Chancellery of his close friend Aleksander Kwasniewski for the first five years of the latter’s Presidency, from 1996 to 2001. Mr Dukaczewski worked directly alongside Marek Siwiec during this period, whilst Mr Siwiec was a Secretary of State in the Presidential Chancellery and then became Chief of the BBN. Jerzy Szmajdzinski was appointed Minister of National Defence for Mr Kwasniewski’s second term, in October 2001. Shortly afterwards, Mr Dukaczewski was nominated Head of the Military Information Services, the WSI, starting in December 2001.", "179. Besides this accountability structure, which remained in place from the immediate aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks throughout Poland’s involvement in the CIA’s covert HVD programme, probably no other Polish official had knowledge of it. Indeed, the ‘highest level of classification’ at national and intergovernmental levels, understood to match NATO’s ‘Cosmic Top Secret’ category, still attaches to the information pertaining to operations in . ...”", "81.  In paragraphs 180-196 the 2007 Marty Report describes “The anatomy of CIA secret transfers and detention in ”. Those paragraphs read, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "“180. Notwithstanding the approach of the Polish authorities towards this inquiry, our team was able to uncover new documentary evidence from two separate Polish sources showing actual landings m  by aircraft associated with the CIA.", "181. These sources corroborate one another and provide the first verifiable records of a number of landings of ‘rendition planes’ significant enough to prove that CIA detainees were being transferred into Poland I can now confirm that at least ten flights by at least four different aircraft serviced the CIA’s secret detention programme m Poland between 2002 and 2005 At least six of them arrived directly from Kabul, Afghanistan during precisely the period in which our sources have told us that High-Value Detainees (HVDs) were being transferred to Poland. Each of these flights landed at the same airport I named m my 2006 report as a detainee drop-off point Szymany.", "182. The most significant of these flights, including the aircraft identifier number, the airport of departure (ADEP), as well as the time and date of arrival into Szymany, are the following", "I N63MU from , arrived in SZYMANY at 14h56 on 5 December 2002", "...", "V N379P from , arrived in SZYMANY at 01h00 on 5 June 2003 ...", "185. The aviation services provider customarily used by the CIA, Jeppesen International Trip Planning, filed multiple ‘dummy’ flight plans for many of these flights The ‘dummy’ plans filed by Jeppesen – specifically, for the N379P aircraft – often featured an airport of departure (ADEP) and/or an airport of destination (ADES) that the aircraft never actually intended to visit. If Poland was mentioned at all in these plans, it was usually only by mention of Warsaw as an alternate, or back-up airport, on a route involving Prague or Budapest, for example Thus the eventual flight paths for N379P registered in Eurocontrol’s records were inaccurate and often incoherent, bearing little relation to the actual routes flown and almost never mentioning the name of the Polish airport where the aircraft actually landed – Szymany.", "186. The Polish Air Navigation Services Agency (Polska Agencja Żeglugi Powietrznej), commonly known as PANSA, also played a crucial role in this systematic cover-up PANSA’s Air Traffic Control in Warsaw navigated all of these flights through Polish airspace, exercising control over the aircraft through each of its flight phases right up to the last phase, when control was handed over to the authority supervising the airfield at Szymany, immediately before the aircraft’s landing PANSA navigated the aircraft m the majority of these cases without a legitimate and complete flight plan having been filed for the route flown.", "...", "190.The analysis of ‘data strings’ has also enabled me to confirm further intricate details of the ‘anatomy’ of these CIA clandestine operations For example, each of these flights was operated under a ‘special status’ or STS designation. The aircraft were thereby exempted from adhering to the normal rules of air traffic flow management (ATFM), and did not, for example, have to wait at airports for approved departure slots. Since such exemptions are only granted when \"specifically authorised by the relevant national authority, they provide further evidence of Polish complicity in the operations. The clearest proof of Poland’s knowledge and authorisation of such landings is demonstrated by the following two-line message, contained in several ‘data strings\" for flights of N379P in 2003:", "‘STS/ATFM EXEMPT APPROVED", " LANDING APPROVED’", "...", "192. In concluding this section it is only fitting that I should note here, with considerable regret, that the cover-up of CIA flights into Szymany seems to have carried over into the approach adopted by the Polish authorities towards my inquiry on the specific question of national aviation records. In over eighteen months of correspondence,  has failed to furnish my inquiry with any data from its own records confirming CIA-connected flights into its airspace or airports. The excuses from the Polish authorities for having failed to do so unfortunately do not seem to be credible.”", "82.  Paragraph 197 explains the transfer of High-Value Detainees into CIA detention in :", "“197. Our enquiry regarding Poland included talks with Polish airport employees, civil servants, security guards, Border Guards and military intelligence officials who hold first-hand knowledge of one or more of the undeclared flights into Szymany Their testimonies are crucial in establishing what happened in the time after these ClA-associated aircraft landed at Szymany The following account is a compilation of testimonies from our confidential sources about these events.", "...", "- Each of these landings was preceded, usually less than 12 hours in advance, by a telephone call to Szymany Airport from the Warsaw HQ of the Border Guards (Straż Graniczna), or a military intelligence official, informing the Director Mr Jerzy Kos of an arriving ‘American aircraft’.", "- The airport manager, who assumed the flights were coming from the United States, was instructed to adhere to strict protocols to prepare for the flights, including cleaning the runways of all other aircraft and vehicles; and making sure that all Polish staff were brought in to the terminal building from the vicinity of the runway, including local security officials and airport employees", "- The perimeter and grounds of the airport were secured by military officers and Border Guards, the latter of whom were registered on a roll-call document that lists names of those present on more than five dates between 2002 and 2005", "- American officials from the nearby Stare Kiejkuty intelligence training base assumed ‘control’ on the dates in question, arriving in several passenger vans m advance of the landing; ‘everything Americans’, said one Polish source present for several landings, ‘even the drivers [of the vans] were Americans’", "- A ‘landing team’ comprising American officials waited at the edge of the runway, in two or three vans with their engines often running; the aircraft touched down in Szymany and taxied to a halt at the far end of the runway, several hundred metres (and out of visible range) from the four-storey terminal control tower.", "- The vans drove out to the far end of the runway and parked at close proximity to the aircraft; officials from within the vans were said to have boarded the aircraft ‘every time’, although it is not clear whether any then stayed on board", "- All the officers charged with ‘processing’ the passengers on these aircraft were Americans; no Polish eye-witness has yet come forward to state whether or not any detainees disembarked the aircraft upon any of these landings – indeed, it may be that no Polish eye-witness to such an event exists.", "- However, asked where the HVDs actually entered , one of our sources in Polish military intelligence confirmed that ‘it was on the runway of Szczytno-Szymany’; another said ‘they come on planes and they entered at this airport’.", "- Documentation, in Polish, attests to persons having been ‘picked up’ [verbal translation] at Szczytno-Szymany in conjunction with at least two aircraft landings in 2003; the documentation also refers to the dispatch of vehicles to the airport from the military unit stationed at the Stare Kiejkuty facility.", "- Having spent only a short time next to the aircraft after each landing, the vans then drove back past the side of the terminal building, without stopping, before leaving airport premises through the front security gate; the vans put their ‘headlights up to full level’ and airport officials say they ‘turned our eyes away’.", "- The vans then drove less than two kilometres along a simple tarmac road, lined by thick pine forest on both sides, through an area which was entirely out of bounds to private or commercial vehicles during these procedures, having been cordoned off for ‘military operations’; at the end of the tarmac road, the vans travelled north-east beyond Szczytno for approximately 15 to 20 minutes before joining an unpaved access road next to a lake.", "- At the end of this access road they reached an entrance of the Stare Kiejkuty intelligence training base, where multiple sources have confirmed to me that the CIA held High-Value Detainees (HVDs) in Poland.”", "83.  Referring to the level of involvement of the Polish authorities, the report, in paragraphs 198-199 stated the following:", "“198. The stringent limitations on information about what happened to detainees \"dropped-off’ at Szymany are perhaps the best example of the ‘need-to-know’ principle of secrecy in practice. Polish officials were not involved in the interrogations or transfers of HVDs, nor did they have personal contact. In explaining his understanding of HVD treatment or conditions in detention, one Polish source said: ‘I have no understanding of detainee treatment. We were not ‘treating’ the detainees. Those were the responsibilities of the Americans.’", "199. We were told that senior Polish military intelligence officials who visited Stare Kiejkuty were ordered to ‘limit rotation and operational demands on Polish officers to make the HVD programme work’. Beyond this fleeting insight, however, neither Polish nor American sources who discussed the HVD programme with us would agree to speak about the exact ‘operational details’ of secret detentions at Stare Kiejkuty, nor would they confirm how long it was operated for, which other facilities were used as part of the same programme in Poland, nor how and when exactly the detainees left the country.”", "(γ)  The 2011 Marty Report", "84.  On 16 September 2011 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted the third report prepared by Senator Marty, entitled “Abuse of state secrecy and national security: obstacles to parliamentary and judicial scrutiny of human rights violations” (“the 2011 Marty Report”), which describes the effects of, and progress in, national inquiries into CIA secret detention facilities in some of the Council of Europe’s member states.", "Paragraphs 9-13 relate to .

In  judicial proceedings which looked quite promising have so far failed to produce any results, also because of the American authorities’ refusal to provide the requested judicial assistance.

In a recent development, prosecutor Jerzy Mierzewski was removed from the file and replaced by the recently appointed deputy appellate prosecutor Waldemar Tyl. Adam Bodnar, of the Polish Helsinki Foundation, criticised this decision as ‘irrational’ and expressed his fear that sooner or later the Polish investigation would be discontinued, as had happened in Lithuania, for which there was ‘no objective reason’. The new prosecutor in charge of the case, Mr Tyl, called the worries ‘groundless. Time will tell.", "12. The Polish prosecuting authorities have not yet secured the desired co-operation from the American authorities or even an opportunity to hear Mr al-Nashiri himself as a witness. But the data collected by the Polish Helsinki Foundation and the victims’ lawyers should be sufficient to confirm the presence at the Stare Kiejkuty site of half a dozen detainees and to identify the head of the ‘black site’ and at least one other person alleged to have committed acts which are described as ‘unauthorised and undocumented’ in the Report by the CIA Inspector General [the 2004 CIA Report] and which seem to correspond to the definition of torture in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ETS No. 5, ‘the Convention’) as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights (‘the Court’) in the case of Ireland v.

It prepared two reports on undisclosed detention on 18 November 2004 and 18 April 2006. These reports still remain classified.", "After President Bush publicly confirmed that 14 terrorist suspects (“high value detainees”) – including the applicant – detained under the CIA detention programme had been transferred to the military authorities in the US Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (see also paragraphs 18 and 89 above), the ICRC was granted access to those detainees and interviewed them in private from 6 to 11 October and from 4 to 14 December 2006. On this basis, it drafted its Report on the Treatment of Fourteen “High Value Detainees” in CIA Custody of February 2007 – the 2007 ICRC Report – which related to the CIA rendition programme, including arrest and transfers, incommunicado detention and other conditions and treatment. The aim of the report, as stated therein, was to provide a description of the treatment and material conditions of detention of the fourteen detainees concerned during the period they had been held in the CIA programme.", "The report was (and formally remains) classified as “strictly confidential”. It was published by the New York Review of Books on 6 April 2009 and further disseminated via various websites, including the ACLU’s site.", "92.  The rendition programme as applied to those detainees is, in so far as relevant, related as follows:", "“  1.  MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE CIA DETENTION PROGRAM", "... The fourteen, who are identified individually below, described being subjected, in particular during the early stages of their detention, lasting from some days up to several months, to a harsh regime employing a combination of physical and psychological ill-treatment with the aim of obtaining compliance and extracting information. This regime began soon after arrest, and included transfers of detainees to multiple locations, maintenance of the detainees in continuous solitary confinement and incommunicado detention throughout the entire period of their undisclosed detention, and the infliction of further ill-treatment through the use of various methods either individually or m combination, in addition to the deprivation of other basic material requirements.", "...", "2.  ARREST AND TRANSFER", "... The fourteen were arrested in four different countries [Thailand, Pakistan, Somali and the ]. In each case, they were reportedly arrested by the national police or security forces of the country in which they were arrested.", "In some cases US agents were present at the time of arrest. All fourteen were detained in the country of arrest for periods ranging from a few days up to one month before their first transfer to a third country ...(reportedly Afghanistan, see below) and from there on to other countries. Interrogation in the country of arrest was conducted by US agents in nearly all cases. In two cases, however, detainees reported having been interrogated by the national authorities, either alone or jointly with US agents:...Hussein Abdul Nashiri was allegedly interrogated for the first month after arrest by  agents.", "During their subsequent detention, outlined below, detainees sometimes reported the presence of non-US personnel (believed to be personnel of the country in which they were held), even though the overall control of the facility appeared to remain under the control of the  authorities.", "Throughout their detention, the fourteen were moved from one place to another and were allegedly kept in several different places of detention, probably in several different countries. The number of locations reported by the detainees varied, however ranged from three to ten locations prior to their arrival in  in September 2006.", "The transfer procedure was fairly standardised in most cases. The detainee would be photographed, both clothed and naked prior to and again after transfer. A body cavity check (rectal examination) would be carried out and some detainees alleged that a suppository (the type and the effect of such suppositories was unknown by the detainees), was also administered at that moment.", "The detainee would be made to wear a diaper and dressed in a tracksuit. Earphones would be placed over his ears, through which music would sometimes be played. He would be blindfolded with at least a cloth tied around the head and black goggles. In addition, some detainees alleged that cotton wool was also taped over their eyes prior to the blindfold and goggles being applied. The detainee would be shackled by hands and feet and transported to the airport by road and loaded onto a plane. He would usually be transported in a reclined sitting position with his hands shackled in front. The journey times obviously varied considerably and ranged from one hour to over twenty-four to thirty hours. The detainee was not allowed to go to the toilet and if necessary was obliged to urinate or defecate into the diaper. On some occasions the detainees were transported lying flat on the floor of the plane and/or with their hands cuffed behind their backs. When transported in this position the detainees complained of severe pain and discomfort.", "In addition to causing severe physical pain, these transfers to unknown locations and unpredictable conditions of detention and treatment placed mental strain on the fourteen, increasing their sense of disorientation and isolation. The ability of the detaining authority to transfer persons over apparently significant distances to secret locations in foreign countries acutely increased the detainees’ feeling of futility and helplessness, making them more vulnerable to the methods of ill-treatment described below.", "The ICRC was informed by the US authorities that the practice of transfers was linked specifically to issues that included national security and logistics, as opposed to being an integral part of the program, for example to maintain compliance. However, in practice, these transfers increased the vulnerability of the fourteen to their interrogation, and was performed in a manner (goggles, earmuffs, use of diapers, strapped to stretchers, sometimes rough handling) that was intrusive and humiliating and that challenged the dignity of the persons concerned. As their detention was specifically designed to cut off contact with the outside world and emphasise a feeling of disorientation and isolation, some of the time periods referred to in the report are approximate estimates made by the detainees concerned. For the same reasons, the detainees were usually unaware of their exact location beyond the first place of detention in the country of arrest and the second country of detention, which was identified by all fourteen as being . This report will not enter into conjecture by referring to possible countries or locations of places of detention beyond the first and second countries of detention, which are named, and will refer, where necessary, to subsequent places of detention by their position in the sequence for the detainee concerned (e.g.. third place of detention, fourth place of detention). The ICRC is confident that the concerned authorities will be able to identify from their records which place of detention is being referred to and the relevant period of detention.", "...", "1.2.  CONTINUOUS SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND INCOMMUNICADO DETENTION", "Throughout the entire period during which they were held in the CIA detention program – which ranged from sixteen months up to almost four and a half years and which, for eleven of the fourteen was over three years – the detainees were kept in continuous solitary confinement and incommunicado detention. They had no knowledge of where they were being held, no contact with persons other than their interrogators or guards. Even their guards were usually masked and, other than the absolute minimum, did not communicate in any way with the detainees. None had any real – let alone regular – contact with other persons detained, other than occasionally for the purposes of inquiry when they were confronted with another detainee. None had any contact with legal representation. The fourteen had no access to news from the outside world, apart from in the later stages of their detention when some of them occasionally received printouts of sports news from the internet and one reported receiving newspapers.", "None of the fourteen had any contact with their families, either in written form or through family visits or telephone calls. They were therefore unable to inform their families of their fate. As such, the fourteen had become missing persons. In any context, such a situation, given its prolonged duration, is clearly a cause of extreme distress for both the detainees and families concerned and itself constitutes a form of ill-treatment.", "In addition, the detainees were denied access to an independent third party. In order to ensure accountability, there is a need for a procedure of notification to families, and of notification and access to detained persons, under defined modalities, for a third party, such as the ICRC. That this was not practiced, to the knowledge of the ICRC, neither for the fourteen nor for any other detainee who passed through the CIA detention program, is a matter of serious concern.", "1.3.  OTHER METHODS OF ILL-TREATMENT", " ... [T]he fourteen were subjected to an extremely harsh detention regime, characterised by ill-treatment. The initial period of interrogation, lasting from a few days up to several months was the harshest, where compliance was secured by the infliction of various forms of physical and psychological ill-treatment. This appeared to be followed by a reward based interrogation approach with gradually improving conditions of detention, albeit reinforced by the threat of returning to former methods.", "The methods of ill-treatment alleged to have been used include the following:", "• Suffocation by water poured over a cloth placed over the nose and mouth, alleged by three of the fourteen.", "• Prolonged stress standing position, naked, held with the arms extended and chained above the head, as alleged by ten of the fourteen, for periods from two or three days continuously, and for up to two or three months intermittently, during which period toilet access was sometimes denied resulting in allegations from four detainees that they had to defecate and urinate over themselves.", "• Beatings by use of a collar held around the detainees’ neck and used to forcefully bang the head and body against the wall, alleged by six of the fourteen.", "• Beating and kicking, including slapping, punching, kicking to the body and face, alleged by nine of the fourteen.", "• Confinement in a box to severely restrict movement alleged in the case of one detainee.", "• Prolonged nudity alleged by eleven of the fourteen during detention, interrogation and ill-treatment; this enforced nudity lasted for periods ranging from several weeks to several months.", "• Sleep deprivation was alleged by eleven of the fourteen through days of interrogation, through use of forced stress positions (standing or sitting), cold water and use of repetitive loud noise or music. One detainee was kept sitting on a chair for prolonged periods of time.", "• Exposure to cold temperature was alleged by most of the fourteen, especially via cold cells and interrogation rooms, and for seven of them, by the use of cold water poured over the body or, as alleged by three of the detainees, held around the body by means of a plastic sheet to create an immersion bath with just the head out of the water.", "• Prolonged shackling of hands and/or feet was alleged by many of the fourteen.", "• Threats of ill-treatment to the detainee and/or his family, alleged by nine of the fourteen.", "• Forced shaving of the head and beard, alleged by two of the fourteen.", "• Deprivation/restricted provision of solid food from 3 days to i month after arrest, alleged by eight of the fourteen.", "In addition, the fourteen were subjected for longer periods to a deprivation of access to open air, exercise, appropriate hygiene facilities and basic items in relation to interrogation, and restricted access to the Koran linked with interrogation.", "...", "For the purposes of clarity in this report, each method of ill-treatment mentioned below has been detailed separately. However, each specific method was in fact applied in combination with other methods, either simultaneously, or in succession. Not all of these methods were used on all detainees^, except in one case, namely that of Mr Abu Zubaydah, against whom all of the methods outlined below were allegedly used.", "1.3.1.  SUFFOCATION BY WATER", "Three of the fourteen alleged that they were repeatedly subjected to suffocation by water. They were: Mr Abu Zubaydah, Mr Khaied Shaik Mohammed and Mr Al Nashiri.", "In each case, the person to be suffocated was strapped to a tilting bed and a cloth was placed over the face, covering the nose and mouth. Water was then poured continuously onto the cloth, saturating it and blocking off any air so that the person could not breathe. This form of suffocation induced a feeling of panic and the acute impression that the person was about to die. In at least one case, this was accompanied by incontinence of the urine. At a point chosen by the interrogator the cloth was removed and the bed was rotated into a head-up and vertical position so that the person was left hanging by the straps used to secure him to the bed. The procedure was repeated at least twice, if not more often, during a single interrogation session. Moreover, this repetitive suffocation was inflicted on the detainees during subsequent sessions. The above procedure is the so-called ‘water boarding’ technique.", "...", "1.3.2.   PROLONGED STRESS STANDING", "Ten of the fourteen alleged that they were subjected to prolonged stress standing positions, during which their wrists were shackled to a bar or hook in the ceiling above the head for periods ranging from two or three days continuously, and for up to two or three months intermittently. All those detainees who reported being held in this position were allegedly kept naked throughout the use of this form of ill-treatment.", "For example, ... Al Nashiri [alleged that he was shackled in this position] for at least two days in  and again for several days in his third place of detention.", "...", "1.3.10.  THREATS", "Nine of the fourteen alleged that they had been subjected to threats of ill-treatment. Seven of these cases took the form of a verbal threat, including of ill-treatment in the form of ‘water boarding’, electric shocks, infection with HIV, sodomy of the detainee and the arrest and rape of his family, torture, being brought close to death, and ofan interrogation process to which ‘no rules applied’.", "... Mr Al Nashiri alleged that, in his third place of detention, he was threatened with sodomy, and with the arrest and rape of his family.", "...", "1.4.  FURTHER ELEMENTS OF THE DETENTION REGIME", "The conditions of detention under which the fourteen were held, particularly during the earlier period of their detention, formed an integral part of the interrogation process as well as an integral part of the overall treatment to which they were subjected as part of the CIA detention program. This report has already drawn attention to certain aspects associated with basic conditions of detention, which were clearly manipulated in order to exert pressure on the detainees concerned.", "In particular, the use of continuous solitary confinement and incommunicado detention, lack of contact with family members and third parries, prolonged nudity, deprivation/restricted provision of solid food and prolonged shackling have already been described above.", "The situation was further exacerbated by the following aspects of the detention regime:", "• Deprivation of access to the open air", "• Deprivation of exercise", "• Deprivation of appropriate hygiene facilities and basic items in pursuance of interrogation", "• Restricted access to the Koran linked with interrogation.", "These aspects cannot be considered individually, but must be understood as forming part of the whole picture. As such, they also form part of the ill-treatment to which the fourteen were subjected.", "...", "Basic materials such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, towels, toilet paper, clothes, underwear, blankets and mattress were not provided at all during the initial detention period, in some instances lasting several months. The timing of initial provision and continued supply of all these items was allegedly linked with compliance and cooperation on the part of the detainee. Even after being provided, these basic items allegedly were sometimes removed in order to apply pressure for purposes of interrogation.", "In the early phase of interrogation, from a few days to several weeks, access to shower was totally denied and toilet, as mentioned above, was either provided in the form of a bucket or not provided at all—in which case those detainees shackled in the prolonged stress standing position had to urinate and defecate on themselves and remain standing in their own bodily fluids for periods of several days (see Section 1.3.2. Prolonged Stress Standing).", "(d)  United Nations Reports", "(i)  The 2010 UN Joint Study", "93.  On 19 February 2010 the Human Rights Council of United Nations Organisation released the “Joint Study on Global Practices in Relation to Secret Detention in the Context of Countering Terrorism of the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism” – “the 2010 UN Joint Study” (A/HRC/1342).", "94.  In the summary, the experts explained their methodology as follows:", "“In conducting the present study, the experts worked in an open, transparent manner. They sought inputs from all relevant stakeholders, including by sending a questionnaire to all States Members of the United Nations. Several consultations were held with States, and the experts shared their findings with all States concerned before the study was finalized. Relevant ехсerpts of the report were shared with the concerned States on 23 and 24 December 2009.", "In addition to United Nations sources and the responses to the questionnaire from 44 States, primary sources included interviews conducted with persons who had been held in secret detention, family members of those held captive, and legal representatives of detainees. Flight data were also used to corroborate information. In addition to the analysis of the policy and legal decisions taken by States, the aim of the study was also to illustrate, in concrete terms, what it means to be secretly detained, how secret detention can facilitate the practice of torture or inhuman and degrading treatment, and how the practice of secret detention has left an indelible mark on the victims, and on their families as well.”", "95.  In respect of secret detention in general, the experts stated the following:", "“Secret detention violates the right to personal liberty and the prohibition of arbitrary arrest or detention. No jurisdiction should allow for individuals to be deprived of their liberty in secret for potentially indefinite periods, held outside the reach of the law, without the possibility of resorting to legal procedures, including habeas corpus. Secret detainees are typically deprived of their right to a fair trial when State authorities do not intend to charge or try them. Even if detainees are criminally charged, the secrecy and insecurity caused by the denial of contact to the outside world and the fact that family members have no knowledge of their whereabouts and fate violate the presumption of innocence and are conducive to confessions obtained under torture or other forms of ill-treatment. At the same time, secret detention amounts to an enforced disappearance. If resorted to in a widespread or systematic manner, secret detention may even reach the threshold of a crime against humanity.", "Every instance of secret detention is by definition incommunicado detention. Prolonged incommunicado detention may facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and may in itself constitute such treatment. The suffering caused to family members of a secretly detained (namely, disappeared) person may also amount to torture or other form of illtreatment, and at the same time violates the right to the protection of family life.", "It is not only States whose authorities keep the detainee in secret custody that are internationally responsible for violations of international human rights law. The practice of ‘proxy detention’, involving the transfer of a detainee from one State to another outside the realm of any international or national legal procedure (‘rendition’ or ‘extraordinary rendition’), often in disregard of the principle of non-refoulement, also involves the responsibility of the State at whose behest the detention takes place. The Geneva Conventions, applicable to all armed conflicts, also prohibit secret detention under any circumstances.”", "96.  The experts also referred to State complicity in secret detention:", "“The experts also address the level of involvement and complicity of a number of countries. For purposes of the study, they provide that a State is complicit in the secret detention of a person when it (a) has asked another State to secretly detain a person; (b) knowingly takes advantage of the situation of secret detention by sending questions to the State detaining the person, or solicits or receives information from persons kept in secret detention; (c) has actively participated in the arrest and/or transfer of a person when it knew, or ought to have known, that the person would disappear in a secret detention facility, or otherwise be detained outside the legally regulated detention system; (d) holds a person for a short time in secret detention before handing them over to another State where that person will be put in secret detention for a longer period; and (e) has failed to take measures to identify persons or airplanes that were passing through its airports or airspace after information of the CIA programme involving secret detention has already been revealed.”", "97.  In relation to , the report (in paragraphs 114-118 stated, among other things, the following:", "“114.  In Poland, eight high-value detainees, ... were allegedly held between 2003 and 2005 in the . ... The Polish press subsequently claimed that the authorities of Poland – during the term of office of President Aleksander Kwasniewski and Prime Minister Leszek Miller – had assigned a team of ‘around a dozen’ intelligence officers to cooperate with the United States on Polish soil, thereby putting them under exclusive American control and had permitted American ‘special purpose planes’ to land on the territory of Poland. The existence of the facility has always been denied by the Government of Poland and press reports have indicated that it is unclear what Polish authorities knew about the facility.", "115. While denying that any terrorists had been detained in , Zbigniew Siemiątkowski, the head of the Polish Intelligence Agency in the period 2002-2004, confirmed the landing of CIA flights. Earlier, the Marty report had included information from civil aviation records revealing how CIA-operated planes used for detainee transfers landed at Szymany airport, near the town of Szczytno, in Warmia-Mazuria province in north-eastem Poland ... between 2003 and 2005. Marty also explained how flights to  were disguised by using fake flight plans.", "116.  In research conducted for the present study, complex aeronautical data, including ‘data strings’ retrieved and analysed, have added further to this picture of flights disguised using fake flight plans and also front companies. For example, a flight from Bangkok to Szymany, Poland, on 5 December 2002 (stopping at Dubai) was identified, though it was disguised under multiple layers of secrecy, including charter and sub-contracting arrangements that would avoid there being any discernible ‘fingerprints’ of a United States Government operation, as well as the filing of ‘dummy’ flight plans. The experts were made aware of the role of the CIA chief aviation contractor through sources in the . The modus operandi was to charter private aircraft from among a wide variety of companies across the , on short-term leases to match the specific needs of the CIA Air Branch. Through retrieval and analysis of aeronautical data, including data strings, it is possible to connect the aircraft N63MU with three named American corporations, each of which provided cover in a different set of aviation records for the operation of December 2002. ... Nowhere in the aviation records generated by this aircraft is there any explicit recognition that it carried out a mission associated with the CIA. Research for the present study also made clear that the aviation services provider Universal Trip Support Services filed multiple dummy flight plans for the N63MU in the period from 3 to 6 December 2002. In a report, the CIA Inspector General discussed the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. Two United States sources with knowledge of the high-value detainees programme informed the experts that a passage revealing that ‘enhanced interrogation of al-Nashiri continued through 4 December 2002\" and another, partially redacted, which stated that: ‘However, after being moved, al-Nashiri was thought to have been withholding information;’, indicate that it was at this time that he was rendered to .

Data strings are exchanges of messages or digital data between different entities (including aviation service providers. Air Navigation Services authorities, airport authorities and government agencies) around the world on the Aeronautical Fixed Telelcommunciation Network (\"AFTN\") or the Société Internationale Télécommunique Aéronautique (\"SITA\") Network’ Data strings record all communications filed in relation to particular aircrafts’ flight plans and movements.", "Based on a detailed analysis of data strings obtained from the Marty Inquiry and of publicly available information – including documentation released by the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency (‘PANSA’) to the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (‘HFHR’) in response to a Freedom of Information request filed under the Statute on Access to Public Information – the Center has been able to assemble information regarding the following in relation to a specific set of flights:", "■ Who planned the flights, through what medium, and in collaboration with whom;", "■ To whom and to what extent information about these flights was communicated through the AFTN or tiie SITA Network;", "■ What permissions were granted for the flights, by whom, and in what form;", "■ Where the aircraft landed and took off, and which different regions of international airspace the aircraft traversed, at what precise times; and", "■ The number of persons on board as declared in the flight plan.", "In combination with corroborating information such as detainee accounts, eye-witness testimony, documentary evidence, and other sources, the data string analysis can also provide insight into – but not conclusively determine – the time frame within which secret detention facilities were operational and the possible location of secret detention facilities. When combined with other evidence, data string analysis can also suggest where a particular detainee was held during a particular time and identify what flight a particular detainee was on when being transported to, from, or between detention facilities. The data string analysis does not, however, conclusively show the purpose of the underlying flights. While data string analysis may suggest that a particular flight was likely used in a rendition, it cannot reveal whether that flight was transporting CIA personnel, resupplying CIA outposts, transporting prisoners, or something else.", "Additionally, data string analysis alone cannot provide information regarding which specific detainees were on which flights, nor can it conclusively pinpoint the exact locations of detention facilities. ...”", "100.  The report further explained that:", "“In this submission, CHRGJ includes information pertaining to two different flight circuits believed to represent CIA ‘rendition circuits’ – one taking place from June 37, 2003 and the other September 20-23, 2003. These flight circuits include landings in and overflights through Polish territory. The data string communications demonstrate that the Polish Government granted licenses and overflight permissions to facilitate these CIA rendition : flights. The data string analysis also reveals conclusively that Jeppesen International Trip Planning (hereinafter ‘Jeppesen’) provided the key travel planning services for these two flight circuits.", "...", "101.  The introductory remarks end with the following conclusion:", "“In sum, examination of the data strings pertaining to the two flight circuits discussed below in conjunction with information available on the public record supports the finding that the United States used Poland as a transit point for several clandestine flights during 2003, that Polish authorities were aware of the clandestine nature of these flights, and that they facilitated them nonetheless, in contravention of international aviation regulations. The data string analysis may also corroborate detainee accounts that they were held in Poland as well as other evidence of the existence of a  secret detention facility on Polish territory.”", "102.  The report further contains a detailed analysis of the data strings concerning flight N379P:", "“Flight records drawn from the database compiled by Council of Europe (‘CoE) Rapporteur Dick Marty show that a Gulfstream V aircraft, registered with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration as N379P, embarked from Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday June 3, 2003 at 23h33m GMT and undertook a fourday flight circuit, during which it landed in and departed from six different foreign countries. These six countries, in the order in which the aircraft landed there, were: Germany, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Poland, Morocco and . The aircraft returned from Portugal to the United States and landed back at Dulles Airport in  on Saturday June 7, 2003.", "...", "I. Who planned the flights, through what medium and in collaboration with whom", "To a great extent, CHRGJ’s analysis reveals that these flights conformed to the most typical attributes of a CIA rendition circuit. First, the familiar travel service provider, responsible for the overall itinerary, route and technical provisions for the aircraft, was Jeppesen. Jeppesen filed a total of eight messages via the AFTN to the movements of N379P in the period from June 3-7, 2003, including seven separate flight plans and one cancellation.", "Second, the aircraft travelled the entire circuit under various forms of exemption and special status, which indicate that the flights were planned and executed with the full collaboration of the United States Government and the ‘host’ states through which the aircraft travelled. In departing from and landing in the , N379P’s flight plans were filed with the annotation ,Department of State Support’. For all other component routes of this circuit (i.e. those routes that did not involve a departure from or a landing in the ), N379P’s flight plans were designated ‘STS/ ATFM EXEMPT APPROVED’ or ‘STS/STATE’. As indicated above, such special status exemptions in their invocation alone demonstrate collaborative planning on the part of the states whose territory or airspace is being traversed, because they are only granted when specifically authorized by the national authority whose territory is being used.", "In each instance that Jeppesen invoked a special status designation for the aircraft N379P, the IFPS operator responded by formally recognizing the designation – first, through inclusion of the relevant portions of the flight plan in copies to other authorities via the AFTN, and second, through acceptance of the flight plans in question.", "II. To whom and to what extent information about these flights was communicated through the Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunications Network or the Société Internationale Télécommunique Aéronautique Network", "All of the communications CHRGJ has found relating to the flight circuit of N379P in this period were exchanged over the AFTN network. Using this medium, the IFPS operator notified multiple national aviation authorities responsible for the component routes planned by Jeppesen for this circuit, by sending a copy of the respective flight plan(s).", "The information filed in relation to the Kabul, Afghanistan to Poland component route of the circuit is an example of the systematic disguise of CIA flights into Poland, involving both American and Polish collaborators, as uncovered by CoE Rapporteur Marty in his 2007 report. Rapporteur Marty concluded that several flights, including N379P’s flight into Poland on June 5, 2003, landed at Szymany Airport in northern Poland notwithstanding the filing of flight plans that indicated the landing was to be in . The fact that Szymany was the actual destination has been corroborated by documentation released by PANSA to HFHR in response to a Freedom of Information request filed under the Statute on Access to Public Information. This newly released documentation confirms that PANSA navigated N379P into Szymany on June 5, 2003 despite all relevant flight plans having named  as the аirport of destination. This indicates that Jeppesen filed \"dummy\" flight plans for the  portion of the June circuit, designed to obscure the fact that the plane actually went to Szymany. The fact that PANSA accepted Jeppesen’s flight plan naming , yet nevertheless navigated the plane to Szymany, demonstrates that once N379P arrived in Polish airspace, Polish authorities did not require it to comply with international aviation regulations by filing a correct flight plan naming Szymany as the plane’s actual point of destination and subsequent departure. PANSA officials therefore collaborated with Jeppesen (and, by extension, with Jeppesen’s client, the CIA) by accepting the task of navigating this disguised flight into Szymany without adhering to international flight planning regulations.", "CHRGJ’s analysis of the data strings reveals that the actual destination of the flight did not feature in any single communication between Jeppesen, PANSA, and the operators of the IFPS. Instead, at 04h59m32s GMT on June 5, 2003, Jeppesen filed a flight plan for the ‘dummy’ route from Kabul to , which was accepted at 04h59m37s GMT by the IFPS operator and copied to the Polish Area Control Centre.", "Later the same day, the IFPS operator twice copied the Kabul-Warsaw flight plan to additional Polish authorities, including the Warsaw-based navigation agency and the Air Traffic Control Tower at . The ‘dummy’ flight plan was disseminated to other national aviation authorities, who were therefore also misled about the plane’s actual destination.", "According to CHRGJ’s analysis, no entity on the AFTN network received notice of the actual destination of the aircraft N379P upon its departure from . Hence N379P touched down secretly in Szymany not – Warsaw – at 0lh00m local time on June 5, 2003, and stayed on the runway for over two hours while the rest of the aviation monitoring community, including Eurocontrol, mistakenly had recorded a stopover in .", "In normal circumstances, there would have had to exist a record of an in-flight change of plan for the aircraft to land at Szymany, or a new filing of an onward flight plan from Szymany; but, due to the invocation of ‘ATFM EXEMPT APPROVED’ special status, N379P was not required to adhere to these carefully conceived air traffic management protocols.", "The cover-up then continued with the filing of the flight plan for the next route of the circuit, this time with a false airport of departure in . At 05h00m37s GMT, just one minute after the IFPS operator had accepted the Kabul-Warsaw ‘dummy’ plan – and over seventeen hours before the aircraft’s scheduled landing in Poland – Jeppesen filed a flight plan for N379P to fly from Warsaw to . Once again, the message was copied only to the Polish Area Control Centre before being accepted by the IFPS operator. At 17h04m42s GMT on June 5, 2003, Jeppesen cancelled its first Warsaw-Rabat plan; but six seconds later, 17h04m48s GMT Jeppesen filed a second, apparently identical plan. Both of these ‘dummy’ flight plans were subsequently circulated to multiple other national aviation authorities, who were therefore also misled as to N379P’s actual point of departure in .", "III. What permissions were granted for the flights, by whom and in what form", "National aviation authorities routinely grant permits for flights to use their airspace or land in their territory, generally upon the specific request of the flight planner. In this case, Jeppesen was granted such routine permits by multiple national authorities. For the route from Kabul, Afghanistan to Szymany, Poland – for which Jeppesen had declared  as its airport of destination in its flight plan – Jeppesen invoked overflight permits from four countries, as well as a landing permit for its declared destination. These permits appeared in the data strings and were accepted by die IFPS operator in the following abbreviated form: ‘WARSAW PMT NDW 7113 113/03’. The data strings indicate that the request for permission to land in Poland was specific to the . CHRGJ’s analysis of the data strings and the PANSA documents obtained by HFHR reveal that Polish officials knowingly issued a permit for , despite the fact that they knew that the aircraft was actually going to land in Szymany.”", "(f)  The 2010 Amnesty International Report", "103.  On 15 November 2010 Amnesty International published a report entitled “Open secret: Mounting evidence of Europe’s complicity in rendition and secret detention”.

The data revealed not only that planes operating in the context of the US rendition and secret detention programmes had landed on Polish territory – mainly at Szymany Airport, near the alleged site of a CIA-operated secret detention facility at Stare Kiejkuty – but also that PANSA had actively collaborated with the CIA to create ‘dummy’ flight plans to cover-up the true destinations of some of the flights: some flight plans listed Warsaw as the destination when in fact the plane had landed at Szymany. According to the data, PANSA also assisted in navigating aircraft into Szymany on two occasions without having received any official flight plans at all.", "After eight years of consistent and often vehement denials of any involvement in CIA counterterrorism operations, the release of the flight data from PANSA marked the first time that a Polish government agency officially confirmed the allegations of Polish involvement in the CIA’s rendition programme.", "Further confirmation of Polish involvement in these operations came in July 2010 with information released to the HFHR from the Polish Border Guard Office indicating that between 5 December 2002 and 22 September 2003 seven aircraft operating in the context of the CIA’s rendition programme landed at Szymany airport. On five of the flights, passengers were aboard on arrival, but on departure only the crew remained on board.", "...", "The official information about passenger numbers partially resolved the question raised in an interview on Polish radio in February 2009 during which prosecutors from the State Prosecutor’s Office publicly acknowledged that they had evidence that 11 flights had landed in , but also stated that they had no evidence that any passengers were aboard. It is also consistent with the claims of unnamed Polish intelligence officials who told the Polish daily Dziennik in September 2008 that the CIA had operated a secret prison inside a military intelligence training base in Stare Kiejkuty in north-eastern  near Szymany airport.", "The findings of the PACE and TDIP reports, in combination with the new evidence disclosed between 2008 and 2010, stand in stark contrast to the conclusions of a 2005 internal inquiry by the Parliamentary Special Services Committee (Komisja do Spraw Służb Specjalnych), which never made its report public, but categorically denied Poland’s involvement in the CIA’s rendition and secret detention programmes.", "Some commentators have analyzed the Border Guard Office information and speculated that the flight landing dates in Poland coincided with the capture and/or transfer of so-called ‘high value detainees who the  government has acknowledged were held in secret prisons abroad. Intergovernmental, non-governmental and press reports had previously identified persons that unnamed CIA sources claimed were held in a Polish secret detention facility. Those names included Abu Zubaydah, Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, among others. Analysis contained in the February 2010 UN Joint Study on Secret Detention, supported by the statements of confidential sources, gave credence to the notion that one of the secret detainees held in Poland was Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a Saudi national alleged to have masterminded the bombing of the USS Cole, and who is currently detained and awaiting trial by military commission in Guantanamo Bay.", "...", "The CIA IG’s report included graphic descriptions of how between 28 December 2002 and 1 January 2003 – during the time it has been alleged that Adb al-Rahim alNashiri was held in secret detention in Poland – one “debriefer” (interrogator) threatened al-Nashiri by racking an unloaded handgun near his head and a separate time by holding a bitless power drill up to his head, while al-Nashiri stood naked and hooded, and revving up the drill. In another instance, the debriefer threatened to bring Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri’s family to the detention facility believing that al-Nashiri would infer that this meant that women family members would be sexually assaulted.119 The IG’s report labelled these techniques as ‘unauthorized’and referred the case to the criminal division of the US Department of Justice, which declined to prosecute.", "...", "Further representations on Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri’s behalf were made in September 2010 when the Open Society Justice Initiative in co-operation with Polish lawyer Mikołaj Pietrzak submitted a request to the Appeals Prosecutor’s Office to pursue specifically a criminal investigation into the ill-treatment of al-Nashiri while in Poland.

A reply from the Prosecutor’s Office on 22 July 2010 reiterated that given to the UN experts: the Polish prosecutors could not comply with Amnesty International’s request for information because the evidence gathered was classified and the prosecutors bound by confidentiality; thus, the results would not be published until the investigation was concluded.", "Despite the general lack of transparency surrounding the investigation into the secret prison, the Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza has reported that prosecutors were considering laying charges against some of Poland’s highest level former officials.
