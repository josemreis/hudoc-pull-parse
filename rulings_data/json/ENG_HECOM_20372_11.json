The aim of the picket was to draw attention to the issue of corruption in the prosecution service. The number of possible participants was declared as up to fifty persons.", "From 5 October 2010 the Executive Committee of the Lviv City Council sought through the courts to ban the above picket.", "On 12 October 2010 the applicant organised, as he had announced on 17 August 2010, a peaceful assembly near the Lviv Regional Prosecutor’s Office between 11.30 a.m. and 12.40 a.m. About twenty-five persons took part in the picket. They were standing on the pavement in front of the building of the Prosecutor’s Office when the police told them that they should keep a distance of five metres away from the building. That would have forced the picketers to stand on the road and impede the flow of traffic. After some discussion with the police, the picketers crossed the road and stood on a lawn on the opposite side of it. The police, however, told the picketers that they could not stand on the lawn and they should move away, which meant standing on the road again and impeding the flow of traffic, causing temporary traffic blockages.", "Immediately afterwards, the applicant was called aside by two police officers. They grabbed his arms and took him in the direction of the nearby police station. Some of the picketers requested the officers to show them their identification and started filming the incident; the officers then let the applicant go.", "On 13 October 2010 the  granted a request by the Executive Committee of the Lviv City Council to prohibit the holding of the pre-announced pickets by the applicant’s NGO as from 19 October 2010.

The applicant telephoned his lawyer, but the latter was not allowed onto the premises of the police station.", "At 11 p.m. the applicant was placed in a cell, where he remained without food until the 3 p.m. on the next day, 14 October 2010.", "On 14 October 2010, before taking him to the court, the police drew up a new report on the administrative offence.", "At 3 p.m. the applicant was taken to the Galytskyy District Court. During the hearing the applicant had no opportunity to study the case-file materials, to obtain the representation of a lawyer or to summon or question any witnesses.
