In particular, the criminal proceedings against him had been completed and the case file was kept at the trial court. Since he was in prison, the applicant could not consult the file himself. He had no contact with his family and only limited contact with the outside world. The applicant’s property had been confiscated following his conviction and he had no source of income. No legal aid was available to him. Therefore, to complete his present application, the applicant had been dependent on the authorities. However, they had not taken into account his specific situation. Despite the fact that he had clearly stated that he needed the copies in connection with his application to the Court, his requests had been refused. As a result, the Court had had to ask the Government to provide the documents concerned. Even though the Government had now submitted the documents, this did not preclude the Court from ruling on the issue arising under Article 34. In the present circumstances, the authorities’ failure to ensure the applicant was provided with a possibility of obtaining copies of documents he needed to substantiate his application had amounted to an unjustified interference with his right of individual petition.", "Conclusion: violation (unanimously).", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the ", ""]}
