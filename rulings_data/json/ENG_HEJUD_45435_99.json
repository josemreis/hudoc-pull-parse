They submitted that the cases disclosed factual complexity as many of them involved a significant number of plaintiffs.", "They submitted further that the subject matter of the applicants’ cases did not call for particular urgency in deciding them. They referred to the Court’s case-law arguing that the cases that do call for special urgency are those that relate to family law matters or to payment of damages to the victims of traffic accidents, those that involve the interests of a great number of persons and the cases concerning dismissal from work.", "The Government argued that the behaviour of the applicants contributed to the delays as they had failed to appear at hearings, to inform the court about their new addresses as well as of those of the defendants and to submit documentation they had relied upon in their claims. They had also failed to seek speeding up of the proceedings.", "With respect to the behaviour of domestic authorities, the Government claimed that the domestic courts showed diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. In particular, the Government pointed out that in the civil proceedings the courts were limited in their activity as they could not take procedural steps on their own initiative but mostly according to the requests of the parties. The Zagreb Municipal Court had held hearings at regular intervals, although the workload at the civil department of that court was huge and each judge was assigned some nine hundred to one thousand cases. The judges had also been changed in many cases.", "86.  The applicants disagreed with the Government. ", "D.  The Court’s assessment", "87.  The Court has examined the course of the proceedings instituted by the applicants within the period after the entry of the Convention into force in respect of Croatia. ", "1.  Proceedings instituted by the first applicant Zvonimir Radoš", "88.  The Court notes that in the proceedings against B.J. no hearing was held or any other procedural step taken between 6 November 1997 and 6 December 2000. The hearing scheduled for the later date was adjourned due to the absence of the presiding judge. The next hearing was scheduled for 20 April 2001. It follows that the overall period of inactivity, entirely attributable to the domestic authorities, amounted to three years, five months and fifteen days.", "89.  In the proceedings against B.B. there was no hearing from 6 November 1997 until 11 April 2001. In that period the first instance court made four unsuccessful requests for a criminal file against the defendant, which created a delay in the proceedings. The Court considers that this delay of three years, five months and six days is attributable to the domestic authorities.", "2.  Proceedings instituted by the second applicant Goran Lajnert", "90.  The Court notes that there was no procedural activity from 5 November 1997 until 10 February 1999, when the first instance court invited the plaintiffs’ counsel to submit a certificate concerning the legal status of company F.I.M.", "Thus, the period of inactivity amounted to one year, three months and five days. Furthermore, it took almost five and half years before the first instance court sought a relevant certificate from the plaintiffs although it could have done so at the beginning of the proceedings.", "3.  Proceedings instituted by the third applicant Dmitar Malešević", "91.  The Court notes that in the proceedings against company V.M.M. and its owner, B.J., the case lay dormant from 2 February 1998 until 10 April 2000, which amounted to two years, two months and eight days.", "The Court notes that the applicant’s counsel failed to appear at one hearing.", "92.  In respect of the proceedings against company F.I.S. and its owner, J.S., the Court notes that there was no activity between 21 May 1999 and 28 December 2000 which amounted to one year, seven months and seven days.", "4.  Proceedings instituted by the fourth applicant Branko Jugović", "93.  The Court notes that in the proceedings against company T.I.A. and its owner I.A. one hearing was adjourned due to the applicant’s absence. ", "Within the period to be taken into account, hearings were held twice per year.", "94.  In respect of the proceedings against company M.J.B. and its owner, B.J., the Court notes that the case lay dormant between 3 February 1998 and 2 April 2001 which amounted to three years, one month and twenty-nine days.", "95.  In the proceedings against company M.B.B. and its owner, B.B., there was no hearing held between 6 November 1997 and 2 April 2001. Within that period the first instance court made four unsuccessful attempts to consult a criminal case-file against B.B. This caused a delay of three years, four months and twenty-six days, attributable to the domestic authorities.", "96.  In the proceedings against T.K.M. and its owner, T.K., no hearing has been held since the Convention entered into force in respect of Croatia, which amounts to almost five years.", "Within that period the first instance court asked the applicant’s counsel to submit T.K.’s address which he did immediately. The court also invited the applicant’s counsel, on 28 June 2000, more than four and half years after the proceedings were instituted to submit a certificate concerning the legal status of T.K.M., although it could have been requested at the beginning of the proceedings.", "5.  Two sets of the proceedings instituted by the fifth applicant Stjepan Živković.", "97.  The Court notes that in the proceedings against M.J.B. and its owner B.J., the first instance court unsuccessfully attempted to consult a criminal case-file against B.J. from 10 September 1998 until 12 October 2000, which caused delay of two years, one month and two days.", "98.  In respect of the proceedings against company F.I.M. and its owner, Đ.M., the Court does not find any significant periods of inactivity. However, the Court notes that the proceedings have so far been pending before the court of first instance for about eight years and three months, out of which a period of about four years and ten months after the ratification of the Convention.", "The Court’s findings with regard to the above eleven sets of proceedings", "99.  In the light of the periods of inactivity and the overall duration of the above proceedings, even if some of the applicants, to some degree, contributed to the length of the proceedings, the Court is not persuaded by the Government’s explanations for the delays. It reiterates that it is for the Contracting States to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can guarantee the right to everyone to obtain a final decision on disputes relating to civil rights and obligations within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, Horvat v Croatia, cited above, § 59).", "100.  In the light of the criteria laid down in its case-law (see, inter alia, the Humen v. Poland [GC], no 26614/95, 15 October 1999, § 60, unpublished, and Comingersoll S.A. v. Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, ECHR 2000-IV) and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the length of the above proceedings failed to satisfy the reasonable time requirement. There has, accordingly, been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of these eleven sets of proceedings.", "6.  Two other sets of the proceedings instituted by the fifth applicant ", "101.  The Court observes firstly that the proceedings against company E. and its owner, S.D., commenced on 24 January 1994 when the applicant lodged his civil action with the Zagreb Municipal Court. However, the period which falls under the Court’s jurisdiction began on 6 November 1997, after the Convention entered into force in respect of Croatia.", "The proceedings ended on 7 May 1998. They therefore lasted for four years, three months and thirteen days, of which a period of six months and one day falls to be examined by the Court.", "The Court notes that at the moment of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Croatia the proceedings had lasted for three years nine months and eleven days.", "Within the period to be taken into account the case had been examined by the court of first instance, which had scheduled four hearings, before adopting judgment in the applicant’s favour.", "The Court finds that the hearings were scheduled at regular intervals and the delays that occurred were not so long as to violate the “reasonable time” requirement. ", "102.  The Court observes further that the proceedings against B.B., commenced on 27 January 1994 when the applicant lodged his civil action with the Zagreb Municipal Court.", "The proceedings ended on 21 November 2000. They therefore lasted for six years, nine months and twenty-four days, of which a period of three years and fifteen days falls to be examined by the Court.", "The Court notes that at the moment of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Croatia the proceedings had lasted for three years nine months and eight days.", "Within the period to be taken into account the case had been examined by the appellate court, following the applicant’s complaint of 18 September 1997 against the first instance judgment of 14 May 1997.", "The Court finds that the period which elapsed after the entry into force of the Convention does not appear excessive having in mind that the case was examined by the appellate court.", "103.  Consequently, in respect of the above two sets of the proceedings instituted by the fifth applicant, there has been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION", "104.  The applicants also submitted that they had no effective remedy whereby they could raise the issue of the excessive length of the proceedings. This, in their view, amounted to a violation of Article 13 of the Convention, which provides:", "“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”", "105.  The Government invited the Court to find this part of the application manifestly ill-founded. They contended that the applicants had the possibility of lodging an application under Section 59(4) of the 1999 Constitutional Court Act. In the Government’s view, that option represented an effective remedy in respect of the length of the proceedings in the applicants’ cases.", "106.  The Court notes that in the Horvat case it found that Section 59(4) of the 1999 Constitutional Court Act did not represent an effective remedy in respect of the length of civil proceedings (see Horvat v. Croatia, cited above, § 65). However, following the Horvat judgment the Croatian Parliament introduced a new Section 63 of the 2002 Constitutional Court’s Act which replaced former Section 59(4). In the Slaviček case the Court found that this new Section provided an effective remedy in respect of complaints concerning length of proceedings (see, Slaviček v. Croatia, cited above).", "107.  The Court finds no reason to come to a different conclusion in the present case, in respect of the proceedings that are still pending before domestic courts. Consequently, there has been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention since there exists now a domestic remedy whereby the applicants may enforce their right to a hearing within a reasonable time as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. ", "108.  However, the Court further notes that the proceedings instituted by the third applicant against company F.I.S. and its owner J.S. were concluded on 19 December 2001. As to the fifth applicant, the proceedings against company E. and its owner S.D. were concluded on 7 May 1998, the proceedings against B.B. were concluded on 21 November 2000 and the proceedings against company M.J.B. and its owner, B.J. were concluded on 12 October 2000.", "The Court finds that at the material time there existed no effective remedy in Croatia which could adequately address the issue of the alleged excessive length of proceedings.", "It follows that in respect of these four sets of proceedings there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention. ", "III.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "109.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "110.  In respect of pecuniary damage the first applicant sought to recover the money he had invested and in respect of non-pecuniary damage he left it to the Court to assess the amount.", "The second applicant failed to make any request in this respect.", "The third applicant sought 20,000 Swiss Francs in respect of both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.", "The fourth applicant sought 150,000 Croatian Kunas.", "The fifth applicant sought 55,640 German Marks and 18,350 Swiss francs in respect of both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.", "111.  The Government asked the Court to assess the amount of just satisfaction to be awarded on the basis of its case-law in civil cases in which normal diligence was required.", "112.  The Court recalls that the violation it has found relates solely to the length of the civil proceedings before the competent tribunals. The applicants’ claims for compensation for pecuniary damage relate, however, to their investments into the so called financial engineering. In these circumstances, no causal link has been established between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged. The applicants’ claims under this head must therefore be rejected.", "113.  The Court accepts that the applicants suffered damage of a non-pecuniary nature as a result of the length of the proceedings. Making its assessment on an equitable basis and having regard to the circumstances of the case – in particular the number of proceedings in respect of each applicant and the overall duration of those proceedings – the Court awards the first applicant 2,500 euros (EUR); the third applicant EUR 2,500; the fourth applicant EUR 4,800 and the fifth applicant EUR 2,500.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "114.  The applicants did not seek reimbursement for costs and expenses. Accordingly, the Court does not award any sum in this respect.", "C.  Default interest", "115.  The Court considers that the default interest should be fixed at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank plus three percentage points.", "THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Dismisses the Government’s preliminary objection;", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of eleven sets of proceedings;", "", "3.  Holds that there has been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the proceedings instituted by the fifth applicant against company E. and its owner S.D. and against B.B.;", "", "4.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention in respect of one set of proceedings instituted by the third applicant and three sets of proceedings instituted by the fifth applicant;", "", "5.  Holds that there has been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention in respect of the other proceedings;", "", "6.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts in respect of non-pecuniary damage:", "(i)  EUR 2,500 (two thousand and five hundred euros) to the first applicant;", "(ii)  EUR 2,500 (two thousand and five hundred euros) to the third applicant;", "(iii)  EUR 4,800 (four thousand and eight hundred euros) to the fourth applicant;", "(iv)  EUR 2,500 (two thousand and five hundred euros) to the fifth applicant.", "", "all of which should be converted into the national currency of the respondent State (Croatian Kuna) at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;", "", "(b)  that simple interest at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank plus three percentage points shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;", "", "7.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicants’ claim for just satisfaction.", "", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 7 November 2002, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tSøren Nielsen\tFrançoise Tulkens\n\tDeputy Registrar\tPresident", ""]}
