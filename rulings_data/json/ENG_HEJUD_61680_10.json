He submitted that the bailiffs had known that M. and C. had been in either Ivano-Frankivsk or . The bailiffs could therefore have conducted simultaneous proceedings in both places, instead of which they had discontinued the enforcement proceedings in one region, transferring the case to the other and then discontinued them again and transferred the case back again. This had happened three times. The applicant submitted that it was worth noting that the police, although aware of the enforcement proceedings being conducted against M., had failed to intervene when she had applied to them for permanent residence in .", "93.  He noted that he had submitted numerous requests to the Ukrainian authorities through the Polish Ministry of Justice for the acceleration of the enforcement proceedings and informed them that he had received messages from M. in which she had threatened him and declared that he would never see their daughter again.

He complained that he had only received notification three days in advance of an enforcement attempt planned for 6 August 2010.", "94.  He criticised the bailiffs for their inactivity and their delays in taking action. He claimed that these failures had not simply violated his and his daughter’s family life, but had ruined it completely. He submitted that the rebuilding of his relationship with his daughter had become very difficult, if not impossible. Adapting to new conditions would now be very difficult for C. In his opinion, the conduct of the enforcement process by the Ukrainian authorities had led to a situation in which his young daughter, deprived of contact with her father, had lost her sense of safety, which was indispensable during adolescence.", "95.  In reply to the third party’s comments (see paragraphs 97 to 103 below), the applicant noted that they generally coincided, with his position. However, he argued that it would not be premature for the Court to deliver its decision on the merits of the case. In his opinion, even if the enforcement proceedings reached a successful conclusion, this could not have an impact on the assessment of the actions taken by the State Bailiffs’ Service of Ukraine in the period between 4 February 2010 and January 2012.", "(b)  The respondent Government", "96.  The respondent Government recognised that the State had a positive obligation to enforce the judgment in question and stated that the bailiffs’ service had repeatedly taken all possible steps to enforce the judgment in the applicant’s favour as soon as possible. They submitted that the applicant had not challenged any actions or failures to act by the bailiffs before the courts; therefore it could be assumed that he had agreed with them. Furthermore, delays in enforcement had also been caused by the behaviour of the applicant’s ex-wife M. as the applicant himself had agreed when he had mentioned this point in letters he had sent to the Ministry of Justice. For example, M. had failed to appear when summoned to do so and, in moving from one city to another, she had knowingly hindered the enforcement proceedings. Furthermore, M.’s relatives, in particular C.’s grandmother and great-grandmother, had further complicated matters by concealing information about the actual whereabouts of M. and C. All these actions had led to the involvement in the proceedings of the police and the bailiffs’ services from two different regions. The Government concluded that the State authorities had taken all the necessary steps to enforce the judgment in the applicant’s favour but had been hindered by the behaviour of private parties for whom the Government could not be held responsible.", "(c)  The third party", "97.  The Polish Government observed that a State’s positive obligations under Article 8 included taking measures to enable parents to be reunited with their children. The decisive issue was therefore whether the national authorities had taken all the measures that could be reasonably demanded of them to facilitate the exercise by a parent of his or her rights of custody, access and parental authority as recognised by the applicable law or granted by a judicial decision.", "98.  They further noted that the above obligation on the national authorities was not absolute and would depend on the circumstances of the particular case. In particular, any obligation to apply coercion in such cases must be limited and the interests and rights of all those involved, and, more particularly, the best interests of the child, should be taken into account. Where contact with the parent might appear to threaten those interests or interfere with those rights, it was for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between them. Furthermore, the positive obligations in this area must be interpreted in the light of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989 and the Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction of 25 October 1980.", "99.  The Polish Government further stated that effective respect for family life required that future relations between parent and child be assessed solely in the light of all relevant considerations and not by the mere efflux of time. Therefore, the adequacy of a measure was to be assessed by the swiftness of its implementation. Proceedings concerning the return of an abducted child, including the enforcement of the final decision, required urgent handling as the passage of time could have irremediable consequences for the relationship between the child and the parent who did not live with him or her. They referred to the position of the Polish Supreme Court, which had confirmed that cases of abduction should be dealt with as a matter of urgency.", "100.  The Polish Government acknowledged that there could be instances in which a lack of cooperation on the part of private individuals might render the return of the child difficult. They, therefore, saw a need for States Parties to the 1980 Hague Convention to develop certain measures and procedures within their legal systems in order to ensure the proper implementation of that Convention. Such measures could include facilitating a compromise between the parties concerned and synchronising various actions by different State authorities in enforcement proceedings.", "101.  They underlined that, as regards the present case, the Polish authorities had been cooperative and had fulfilled their obligations under the Hague Convention. Their Ministry of Justice, as well as their Consuls General in Lviv and Sebastopol, had acted with due diligence. The consuls in question had also provided the Government with information about the conduct of the Ukrainian authorities in the enforcement proceedings. Both consuls were unanimous that the execution of the judgment in the present case had been ineffective throughout the two-year period. According to the consul in , the Ukrainian authorities had not been able to find C. although they knew which school she had been attending. Furthermore, C.’s place of residence in  had been established by the Ukrainian authorities after pressure from the Polish Consulate. In the consuls’ opinion, the Ukrainian authorities had been seen to be declaring their full cooperation, good will and commitment while no effective action had actually been taken by them for a significant period of time. The Polish Government also noted the applicant’s criticism of the Ukrainian authorities for the lack of synchronisation of their actions, in that they had established two possible addresses for C. but had checked one after the other, instead of checking both at the same time.", "102.  Lastly, the Polish Government noted that the first successful attempt to execute the judgment of 4 February 2010 had taken place on 23 January 2012, when the applicant had met with his daughter in the presence of the Polish Consul. C. had refused to return to  with her father but had agreed to visit him there during the spring holidays.", "103.  The Polish Government concluded that there were grounds to believe that the recent developments might lead to the effective enforcement of the judgment of 4 February 2010 and to the successful restoration of family ties between the applicant and his daughter. They noted the good will on the part of the applicant and his reluctance to traumatise his child with coercive enforcement measures. They also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had stepped up their efforts in January 2012. They considered that it would be premature to decide on the merits of the case as the situation was unpredictable and subject to change, and therefore further developments should be awaited.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "104.  As the relationship between the applicant and his daughter is one of family life for the purposes of Article 8 of the Convention, the Court needs to determine whether there has been a failure to respect the applicant’s family life. The Court reiterates that the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities. There are in addition positive obligations inherent in an effective “respect” for family life. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see, among other authorities, Ignaccolo-Zenide v. Romania, no. 31679/96 § 94, ECHR 2000-I; Iglesias Gil and A.U.I. v. Spain, no. 56673/00, § 48, ECHR 2003V; and Mikulić v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, § 58, ECHR 2002I).", "105.  Furthermore, the Court has consistently held that the State’s positive obligation under Article 8 includes a right for parents to have access to measures which will enable them to be reunited with their children and an obligation on the national authorities to take such action. However, the obligation on the national authorities to take such measures is not absolute, since the reunion of a parent with a child who has lived for some time with the other parent may not be able to take place immediately and may require preparatory measures. Any obligation to apply coercion in this area must be limited since the interests and the rights and freedoms of all concerned must be taken into account, and more particularly the best interests of the child and his or her rights under Article 8. Where contacts with the parent might appear to threaten those interests or interfere with those rights, it is for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between them (see Sylvester v. Austria, nos. 36812/97 and 40104/98, § 58, 24 April 2003.", "106.  In cases concerning the enforcement of decisions in the realm of family law, the Court has repeatedly found that what is decisive is whether the national authorities have taken all the necessary steps to facilitate execution which can reasonably be demanded in the special circumstances of each case. In examining whether the failure to enforce a court order amounted to a lack of respect for the applicant’s family life, the Court must strike a fair balance between the interests of all persons concerned and the general interest in ensuring respect for the rule of law. In cases of this kind the adequacy of a measure is to be judged by the swiftness of its implementation, as the passage of time can have irremediable consequences for relations between the child and the parent who does not live with him or her (see Sylvester, cited above, §§ 59-60).", "107.  Lastly, the Court considers that the positive obligations which Article 8 of the Convention imposes on the Contracting States with respect to reuniting parents with their children must be interpreted in the light of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction of 25 October 1980 (see Ignaccolo-Zenide, cited above, § 95) and the concept of the child’s “best interests” is also a primary consideration in the context of the procedures provided for in the Hague Convention (see Neulinger and Shuruk v.  [GC], no. 41615/07, § 76, ECHR 2010).", "108.  In the circumstances of the present case the Court notes that it took the Ukrainian courts almost a year to order the return of C. to  and almost two years to conduct the first partially successful attempt to enforce the judgment of 4 February 2010, by which the return had been ordered. The Court accepts that the actions of a private individual, M., and her relatives hindered the enforcement proceedings; however, it should be noted that M. and C. had been living in  quite openly. C. was attending a State secondary school and was an outpatient at a public hospital, and her mother M. had been in contact with the domestic authorities (see paragraphs 15, 17, 19, 21, 24, 56 and 69 above). In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the bailiffs had an impossible task to perform in tracing their whereabouts and in at least bringing C. into contact with her father. The actions taken by the domestic authorities appeared to be formalistic and uncoordinated, although, according to the respondent Government, these had been the only steps possible for the enforcement of the judgment. The penalty provided by the domestic law for hindering the enforcement procedure is formulated in very general terms and the Government did not argue that the bailiffs could effectively have brought M. and her relatives to account for deliberate obstruction of the enforcement proceedings. At the same time the application of the only clearly formulated penalty against M. for failure to enforce the judgment, namely the fine (see paragraph 82 above), does not appear to be ever considered by the bailiffs, even though it would probably be to no avail until M. could be effectively located and contacted. If the competence of the bailiffs was limited, as the Government maintained, only to the actions that were actually taken by the bailiffs in this case, the applicant could not be reproached for not challenging the bailiffs’ actions in the courts. Furthermore, the Government did not demonstrate in what way any further judicial action by the applicant could have accelerated the enforcement proceedings, nor did they furnish any examples of the domestic case-law applied to that effect in any previous cases of child abduction. Therefore, the Government’s objection as to admissibility must be dismissed.", "109.  The Court finds that the present case demonstrates that the actions available, under domestic law, to the Ukrainian bailiffs’ service were not sufficient in the circumstances to face the challenges of the enforcement of the judgment and the lack of effectiveness of the enforcement led to a serious rupture of the family ties between the applicant and his daughter.", "There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION", "110.  The applicant also complained that the lengthy failure to enforce the judgment ordering the return of his daughter to Poland was in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the relevant part of which reads as follows:", "“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by a ... tribunal ...”", "A.  Admissibility", "111.  The Court notes that this complaint is linked to the one examined above and must therefore likewise be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "112.  Having regard to its findings in relation to Article 8 (see paragraphs 108 and 109 above), and that it was the unreasonable delay by the court and the subsequent enforcement proceedings which were at the heart of the applicant’s complaint, the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine whether, in the instant case, there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 (see Sylvester, cited above, § 77).", "III.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "113.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "114.  The applicant claimed 30,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "115.  The Government considered the claimed amount exorbitant and completely unsubstantiated.", "116.  The Court, ruling on an equitable basis, awards the applicant EUR 7,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "117.  The applicant also claimed 13,599 Polish złotys (PLN -approximately EUR 3,285) for costs and expenses incurred at the domestic level and before the Court.", "118.  The Government considered that the majority of the claimed expenses submitted were not sufficiently specific and detailed.", "119.  According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the amount claimed in full.", "C.  Default interest", "120.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Declares the application admissible;", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;", "", "3.  Holds that there is no need to examine the complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;", "", "4.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:", "(i)  EUR 7,500 (seven thousand five hundred euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;", "(ii)  EUR 3,285 (three thousand two hundred and eighty-five euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "5.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 17 January 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tClaudia Westerdiek\tMark Villiger\n\tRegistrar\tPresident"]}
