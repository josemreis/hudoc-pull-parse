Its application was rejected, whereupon it applied to the Supreme Administrative Court for the decision to be set aside. The company’s lawyer filed the application at Athens 4th police station.

They did not, however, note the registration number on the record of the document constituting the application itself. The Supreme Administrative Court, basing its decision on that omission, ruled the application inadmissible on the ground of a procedural flaw. Its judgment was put into final form on 16 May 1997 and the applicant was sent a copy of it on 13 June 1997.", "Admissible under Articles 6 § 1 (access to a court) and 13. As regards the applicability of Article 6, the mere fact that the subsidy requested by the applicant company was a state subsidy did not in itself rule out the existence of a civil right.

He had a duty to assess the circumstances of every company and to grant a subsidy if the statutory conditions were fulfilled. The decision could subsequently be challenged in the Supreme Administrative Court, whose definition determined the civil right in issue.", "The applicant company’s claim thus concerned a civil right and Article 6 was applicable.", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the "]}
