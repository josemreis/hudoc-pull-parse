According to the report produced by the authorities and signed by the applicant, prior to 8:40 a.m. he was shown the order to appear and was informed that he would be taken do the N.A.D.’s office. He was also informed that he could retain the services of a chosen legal representative. He refused to do so because he considered that he did not need one.", "5.  On the same date, at 12 p.m., the prosecutor investigating his case informed the applicant in the presence of a publicly appointed legal representative that a criminal investigation had been opened against him for bribe taking. According to the documents submitted before the Court, he refused to retain a chosen legal representative and accepted to be assisted by a publicly appointed lawyer. According to the statement made before the prosecutor, he notified the authorities that he was suffering from diabetes and that he needed his treatment with insulin which had to be recovered from his workplace. In addition, he requested in the event of his arrest that the authorities notify his wife. Moreover, he stated that he maintained the statement he had previously made before the N.A.D. in respect of the events he was investigated for.", "6.  On the same date, at 7:36 p.m., the applicant was informed that he was charged with bribe taking.

It held that according to the available evidence there was reasonable suspicion that the applicant received money from Turkish nationals in order to allow them to return to . In addition, the offence in question was punishable by more than four years imprisonment and his release was a danger to public order considering that he was a border guard officer and that he committed the offence at his workplace.", "8.  On 10 March 2010, by relying on testimonial, document and audio surveillance evidence, the N.A.D. asked the domestic courts to detain the applicant pending trial.", "9.  By an interlocutory judgment of 10 March 2010 the Court of Cassation dismissed the N.A.D.’s request and ordered the applicant’s release under the condition not to leave the country. It held that the available evidence was plagued by some inconsistencies which should have been remedied by the investigating authorities. In addition, except for the seriousness of the offence none of the other legal requirements to detain the applicant pending trial were met. In particular, there was no evidence in the file that he attempted to abscond or to obstruct justice. Also, it was not proven that his release would be a danger to public order, considering that the events in questioned happened in 2007 and that the applicant was not responsible for the length of the criminal investigation. Consequently, it considered that the use of an alternative measure was more appropriate in his case.", "10.  By a final interlocutory judgment of 8 April 2010 the Court of Cassation, sitting as a second instance court, dismissed as ill-founded the N.A.D.’s appeal against the interlocutory judgment of 10 March 2010.", "11.  By a judgment of 17 March 2010 the Bucharest Court of Appeal convicted the applicant for bribe taking and sentenced him to three years imprisonment. The applicant appealed on points of law (recurs) against the judgment.", "12.  The proceedings are still pending before the domestic courts.", "2.  Criminal proceedings opened by the applicant against prosecutor G.B.", "13.  On 21 April 2010 the applicant brought criminal proceedings with no civil claims against the prosecutor investigation his case, in particular G.B., for inter alia abuse of power, unlawful arrest and torture. He argued inter alia that the prosecutor had obtained testimonial evidence against him in breach of domestic and international criminal procedure rules and had detained him for thirty eight hours instead of the lawfully allowed twenty four. In addition, there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence or that the other lawfully required criteria for his detention were met. Also, he was subjected to intense physical and psychological pain because the order to appear issued by the prosecutor was unjustified and lacked any reasoning in breach of Article 183 (2) of the Romanian Code of Criminal Procedure (“the C.C.P.”). Lastly, he was refused medical examination, treatment and food for the entire time he was under the authorities’ control although he had notified them of his medical condition.", "14.  By a final order of 2 July 2010 the Public Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s criminal complaint against the prosecutor G.B. on the grounds that the offences invoked by the applicant were inexistent and that his claims amounted to a complaint against the acts and measures carried out by the prosecutor during the investigation stage of the criminal proceedings opened against him. The scope of a criminal complaint was not, however, to censor the acts and measures carried out by the prosecutor. The lawfulness of such measures could only be examined within the framework of a complaint lodged with the hierarchical prosecutor against the acts and measures carried out by the investigating prosecutor. The applicant appealed against the order before the domestic courts and argued that the public prosecutors failed to investigate his complaints.", "15.  By final interlocutory judgments of 16 November 2010 and 18 January 2011 the Court of Cassation ordered that the investigation file be attached to the court’s file and that G.B. be summoned before the court.

It held that the applicant had other legal remedies provided for by the criminal procedure rules which he could have exhausted in respect of his complaints against the acts and measures taken by the prosecutor during the criminal proceedings opened against him. In this connection it identified several complaints he could have lodged with the hierarchical prosecutor against the acts and measures undertaken by the investigating authorities and which he could have used within the framework of the criminal proceedings opened against him. In addition, it held that a criminal complaint lodged against the prosecutor investigating his case was not one of the remedies he could have used to express his dissatisfaction with the said prosecutor, as it gave him the possibility to have aspects of lawfulness concerning the pending criminal trial examined outside the framework of the criminal proceedings opened against him. Moreover, the procedure allowing the prosecutor’s orders to be challenged before domestic courts, did not allow it to substitute its judgment to that of the judicial organs charged with the examination of the pending criminal proceedings opened against him. The applicant appealed on points of law (recurs) against the judgment.", "17.  By a final judgment of 12 September 2011, delivered in private, the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law against the judgment of 12 April 2011 as inadmissible.

It held that to order the Court of Cassation to examine his appeal on points of law would breach the principle of legal certainty. In addition, the unconstitutionality objections in question had been raised by the applicant after the proceedings ended on 12 April 2011 and there was no legal framework that would allow the Court of Appeal to force another court to examine them. The applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment. According to him, the appeal on points of law was dismissed as ill-founded.", "3.  Criminal proceedings opened by the applicant against prosecutor L.P.", "20.  On 31 May 2010 the applicant brought criminal proceedings with no civil claims against the prosecutor L.P., G.B.’s hierarchical prosecutor, for abuse of power, instigation to perjury, unlawful repression and retention and destruction of documents. He claimed that, as G.B.’s hierarchical prosecutor, L.P. had approved the criminal investigation measures taken by G.B., including the evidence dismissed and gathered by him, and allowed G.B. to detain him and initiate the criminal proceedings against him although he was aware that he was innocent.", "21.  By a final order of 28 October 2010 the Public Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s criminal complaint against the prosecutor L.P. on the ground that the offences invoked by the applicant were inexistent. It held inter alia that the complaints lodged by the applicant against L.P. were linked to those lodged by him against G.B. In the latter’s case the Prosecutor’s Office had already discontinued the criminal investigation for similar reasons. The applicant appealed against the order before domestic courts and argued that the public prosecutors failed to investigate his complaints.", "22.  By a final judgment of 28 March 2011 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s complaint against the order of 28 October 2010. It held that L.P. had not investigated the applicant’s case and had not taken any acts and measures in this respect. The fact that he examined and dismissed his complaints in respect of the lawfulness of the criminal proceedings opened against him does not engage his criminal liability in the absence of evidence to suggest otherwise. In addition, the applicant’s complaints concern mainly challenges against the evidence raised against him in the course of the criminal proceedings opened by the authorities and can be examined only within the framework of the said set of criminal proceedings.", "4.  Other sets of criminal proceedings opened by the applicant against prosecutors G.B. and L.P.", "23.  On 4 August 2011 the applicant brought criminal proceedings with no civil claims against prosecutors G.B. and L.P. for breach of the secrecy of his correspondence.

It held inter alia that the offences alleged by him were in fact allegations of breaches of procedural rules by the prosecutor investigating his case which could have been examined by the appellate courts over the course of the criminal proceedings opened against him, particularly since the said proceedings were still pending before the domestic courts.", "25.  By a final order of 26 June 2012 the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Court of Cassation dismissed the criminal proceedings opened by the applicant against prosecutors G.B. and L.P. on 4 August 2011 on the ground that no unlawful act had been committed.

At the N.A.D.’s office he was left to wait in a room until 12 p.m. when the police officers informed him that he needed to retain the services of a legal representative. Around 10 p.m. he was handcuffed and taken to the detention centre.

Lastly, he argued that he had not been informed promptly of the reasons for his detention.", " 3.  Invoking Article 6 of the Convention the applicant complains of a breach of his right to fair trial in so far as the Court of Cassation lacked impartiality and failed to provide reasons for its decisions delivered in the criminal proceedings opened by him against prosecutors G.B. and L.P. In addition, in respect of the proceedings which ended by the final judgments of 28 March and 12 April 2012 the courts failed to hear G.B. and L.P. and examined his complaints without being provided with a copy of the criminal investigation files by the Prosecutor’s Office. Moreover, the prosecutor arguing the cases presented his argument for the dismissal of the cases from the same podium that was occupied by the court’s bench. Furthermore, the domestic legislation prevented him from lodging appeals on points of law against the judgments of 28 March and 12 April 2011 and therefore his appeals on points of law and unconstitutionality objections raised after the said judgments became final were dismissed as inadmissible by final judgments delivered in private. Lastly, he did not have access to the list of judges that examined his appeals on points of law against the judgments of 28 March and 12 April 2011 and was unable to establish if they had been the same judges that examined his case as a first instance court and to lodge a challenge against them if that was the case.", "Relying on the same Articles of the Convention the applicant complains of the unfairness of the criminal proceedings opened against him in so far as the first instance court lacked impartiality and dismissed all the evidence requested by the defence and sentenced him on 17 March 2011 exclusively on the basis of witness testimonies obtained from witnessed that had not been summoned before the court.
