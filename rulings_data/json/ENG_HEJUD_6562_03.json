The Armenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr G. Kostanyan, Representative of the  at the European Court of Human Rights.", "3.  The applicant alleged that the interference with his right to freedom of peaceful assembly was contrary to the guarantees of Article 11 of the Convention, in particular, that it was not prescribed by law.", "4.  The application was allocated to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.", "5.  By a decision of 20 October 2005, the Court declared the application partly admissible.", "6.  The applicant and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other's observations.", "THE FACTS", "I.  THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE", "7.  The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in .", "8.  The applicant at the material time was a member of the “Republic” Party («Հանրապետություն» կուսակցություն).", "9.  On 10 May 2002 the “Republic” Party applied to the Mayor of Yerevan for permission to hold a demonstration on  in  on 14 May 2002.", "10.  On 13 May 2002 the Mayor authorised the demonstration as requested.", "11.  The demonstration was held as planned on 14 May 2002, at around 15.00, on . It was jointly organised by the “Republic” Party and six other political parties. The applicant participated in the demonstration.", "12.  Following the demonstration, at around 16.00, the applicant called on participants to hold a procession through the  towards the Parliament building. It appears that a crowd of people followed the applicant in a procession along the Avenue.", "13.  The same day, at 23.10, the applicant was arrested and brought to the Arabkir District Police Station of Yerevan (ՀՀ ոստիկանության Երևան քաղաքի Արաբկիրի բաժին). The record of an administrative offence (վարչական իրավախախտման արձանագրություն) prepared by the police officers stated that the applicant had “organised an unlawful procession and violated the prescribed rules for holding demonstrations and street processions”.", "14.  On 15 May 2002 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan (Երևան քաղաքի Կենտրոն և Նորք-Մարաշ համայնքների առաջին ատյանի դատարան) examined the applicant's case.

EUR 1 at the material time). The decision was final and not subject to appeal.", "16.  On 24 May 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Civil Court of Appeal (ՀՀ քաղաքացիական գործերով վերաքննիչ դատարան). In his appeal the applicant argued that in accordance with the Constitution he had a right to contest the decision of the District Court before a higher court. He further argued that the interference with his right to freedom of assembly was not prescribed by law, as there did not exist any law which prescribed the rules that the applicant had allegedly violated. Furthermore, he expressly requested the Court of Appeal to name any such law if it existed.", "17.  On 14 June 2002 the Civil Court of Appeal examined the applicant's appeal and found that:", "“On 14 May 2002 at around 15.00 o'clock [the applicant] participated in an authorised demonstration on the  in .

The Law was adopted before Armenia's independence of 23 August 1990, but continued to be valid following independence by virtue of Article 16 of the Constitutional Law on the Foundations of Independent Statehood of 25 September 1991, since the phrase “valid Constitution and laws” referred to in that Article also included the laws of the former USSR. Thus, from 1991 to 1995 the Law continued to operate as a law of the . Following the adoption of the Constitution on 5 July 1995, the Law continued to be valid by virtue of Article 116 § 2 of the Constitution.", "31.  The applicant submitted that a law must be accessible and foreseeable. The Law was not accessible since he was not able to find it. Furthermore, he asked why, if the Law was valid, the courts failed to refer to it. In any event, the Law was not valid in Armenia because of Article 11 of the CIS Convention of 8 December 1991 which prohibited the application of the former  laws on the territory of the signatory states. This Convention was signed and ratified by  on 8 December 1991 and 18 February 1992, respectively.", "32.  In their further observations, the Government submitted that the Law was accessible since it was published in Bulletin no. 31 of the Supreme Soviet of the  of 3 August 1988. Article 11 of the CIS Convention did not apply to the Law, because the Law, by the time when the Republic of Armenia joined this Convention, was already operating as a law of the  by virtue of Article 16 of the Constitutional Law of 25 September 1991. Following 1995 it continued to operate on the basis of the Constitution.", "33.  In his further observations, the applicant submitted that a law which had lost its force in 1991 due to the CIS Convention could not re-acquire force in 1995 by virtue of the Constitution. Furthermore, the Decree could not be applied in practice since it contained concepts which did not exist any more after the dissolution of the , such as an “executive committee of the local council of people's deputies” and a “superior authority” to which the executive committee's decision could be appealed.", "34.  In the proceedings on the merits, the Government submitted that the Law was valid and applicable in practice. It would have been irrational to terminate the validity of all previously adopted laws and legal acts from the date when the Republic of Armenia became independent and did not yet have its own legal system, because then the country would have faced a legal crisis. Thus, not only the Law but also many other laws adopted during the USSR period continued and still continue to be valid in the . As an example of this serves the Decision of the Supreme Council of Armenia of 26 February 1992 on “Putting into Application of the Law of the Republic of Armenia on Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activities”, paragraph 15 of which stated that the application of the former USSR laws on “Cooperative Activity in the USSR” and “State Enterprises (Unions)” was to be allowed on the territory of the Republic of Armenia. Also, until the adoption of relevant rules on 23 May 2002, entire road traffic in  was regulated by the Decree of the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs of 2 November 1979. Finally, in accordance with legislative technical rules, a legal act is applicable in the country until a decision on its termination is adopted. Thus, a new law on holding demonstrations and rallies was adopted in Armenia on 28 April 2004, Article 16 of which stated that, from the date of entry into force of this law, the Decree was not to be applied on the territory of the .", "35.  The Government further repeated their submissions that Article 11 of the CIS Convention did not apply to the Law. It concerned only the USSR legal acts which were adopted within the short period from the moment of Armenia's independence until the dissolution of the  in December 1991. All other USSR legal acts adopted before Armenia's independence, including the Law, had been already recognised by  as constituting part of its own legislation by virtue of Article 16 of the Constitutional Law of 25 September 1991. The Government further submitted that the Law applied to the entire  territory and was therefore an integral part of the legislation of the former Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR). Thus, it was directly transformed into the legislation of the Republic of Armenia on the basis of Articles 1 and 2 of the 's Declaration of Independence.", "36.  In reply, the applicant repeated that the Law could not be valid by virtue of Article 11 of the CIS Convention. He further submitted that, in accordance with Article 1 of the Declaration of Independence, the former ASSR was succeeded by the . Thus, according to Article 2 of the Declaration, only the laws of the former ASSR were valid on the territory of the Republic of Armenia, and not those of the former .", "B.  The Court's assessment", "1.  Whether there was an interference with the exercise of the freedom of peaceful assembly", "37.  It has not been disputed between the parties that the applicant's conviction constituted an interference with his right to freedom of peaceful assembly. The Court recalls that the term “restrictions” used in Article 11 § 2 cannot be interpreted as not including measures – such as punitive measures – taken not before or during but after a meeting (Ezelin v. France, judgment of 26 April 1991, Series A no. 202, § 39). The Court concludes that there has been an interference with the applicant's right to freedom of peaceful assembly.", "2.  Whether the interference was justified", "38.  An interference will constitute a breach of Article 11 unless it is “prescribed by law”, pursues one or more legitimate aims under paragraph 2 and is “necessary in a democratic society” for the achievement of those aims.", "39.  The Court reiterates that the expression “prescribed by law” in Article 11 of the Convention not only requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law, but also refers to the quality of law in question. The law should be accessible to the persons concerned and formulated with sufficient precision to enable them – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see, for example, Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1), judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 31, § 49; Rekvényi v. Hungary [GC], no. 25390/94, § 34, ECHR 1999III; Rotaru v. Romania [GC], no. 28341/95, § 55, ECHR 2000V; Maestri v.  [GC], no. 39748/98, § 30, ECHR 2004I). The Court also recalls that such factors as the national courts' lack of reference to any legal provision as a basis for the interference and the apparent inconsistencies of case-law compared to the national legislation may constitute grounds for the failure of a given legal provision to meet the requirement of foreseeability (see, in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Baklanov v. , no. 68443/01, § 46, 9 June 2005).", "40.  The Court notes that the fine was imposed on the applicant under Article 180.1 of the CAO, which prescribed a penalty for the violation of the prescribed rules for organising and holding rallies and street processions. Therefore, the interference had a basis in domestic law. It has not been disputed that the CAO was accessible and the Court does not have reason to doubt that. It remains, therefore, to be determined whether this provision was foreseeable.", "41.  The Court notes that it is in dispute between the parties whether at the material time there was any legal act in  which envisaged the “prescribed rules” referred to in Article 180.1 of the CAO. The Government alleged that the “prescribed rules” were envisaged by the Law and the Decree, while the applicant contended that these were legal acts of the former USSR and were no longer valid and applicable in  following its independence. Thus, according to him, no “prescribed rules” existed in  which he was found to have violated. In support of their arguments, both parties advanced their own interpretation of various domestic and international provisions, such as 's Declaration of Independence, the Constitutional Law on the Foundations of Independent Statehood, the Constitution of 1995 and the CIS Convention.", "42.  In this respect, the Court notes that these documents allow various interpretations as to the applicability of the former  laws. There is no domestic provision which clearly stated whether the former USSR laws remained or did not remain in force on the . While the Decision of the Supreme Council of Armenia of 26 February 1992, as pointed out by the Government, explicitly allowed the application of two former USSR laws on the  (see paragraph 34 above), no such decision was ever adopted in respect of the Law or the Decree. Furthermore, the Court does not agree with the Government that Armenia would have faced a legal crisis if the former USSR laws were no longer applied after its independence, since it is clear from Articles 1 and 2 of Armenia's Declaration of Independence that all the legal acts of the former ASSR, which included a constitution and all the vital codes, were transformed into legal acts of the newly independent Republic of Armenia. It is not obvious, however, from the wording of these provisions whether the same applied to the former  laws.", "43.  The Court recalls that its power to review compliance with domestic law is limited as it is in the first place for the national authorities to interpret and apply that law. The Court, however, would draw attention to the absence of any domestic case-law concerning the disputed matter. Notwithstanding the Court's request, the Government failed to submit any examples of domestic practice, such as copies of any court decisions or judgments which would clarify this issue or at least make references to any former  laws, in general, or the Law and the Decree, in particular. Furthermore, the domestic courts in the present case also failed to refer to any legal act which prescribed the rules for holding rallies and street processions which the applicant was found to have violated. Thus, having regard to the domestic courts' lack of reference to any legal provision prescribing the rules in question and to the absence of any case-law concerning the applicability of the former USSR laws in Armenia following its independence, the Court considers that the law in question, namely the “prescribed rules” referred to in Article 180.1 of the CAO, was not formulated with such precision as to enable the applicant to foresee, to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences of his actions (see, mutatis mutandis, in the context of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Baklanov, cited above). The Court notes that following the dissolution of the USSR there was no legal act applicable in  which contained these rules and the relevant law was adopted only on 28 April 2004. The Court accepts that it may take some time for a country to establish its legislative framework in a transition period, but it cannot accept the delay of almost thirteen years to be justifiable, especially when such a fundamental right as freedom of peaceful assembly is at stake. The Court concludes that the interference with the applicant's right to freedom of peaceful assembly was not prescribed by law.", "44.  Having reached this conclusion, the Court does not need to verify whether other two requirements (legitimate aim and necessity of the interference) set forth in Article 11 § 2 have been complied with.", "45.  Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention.", "II.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "46.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "47.  The applicant claimed EUR 5,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. In particular, he submitted that, as a result of the unlawful interference, his reputation as a political activist was seriously damaged. The imposition of a fine was degrading in the eyes of his party colleagues, as well as his family and those citizens who supported his party. The applicant made no claim in respect of pecuniary damage.", "48.  The Government contested his claim. Referring to the judgment in the case of Ezelin v. France (judgment of 26 April 1991, Series A no. 202, §§ 55-57), they submitted that the finding of a violation would in itself constitute sufficient compensation. In any event, the amount claimed was excessive.", "49.  The Court considers that the finding of a violation of the Convention constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "50.  The applicant made no claim under this head.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention;", "", "2.  Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 11 January 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tVincent Berger\tBoštjan M.
