Their subsequent petitions and appeals, as far as the Courts-Martial Appeal Court (the full court in all cases except Mr Moore's), were unsuccessful. The applicants complained that the courts-martial which tried them were not independent and impartial, referring in particular to the role of the \"convening officer\".", "Law: Article 6 § 1 - In view of the potential or actual penalties together with the nature of the charges against the applicants, the Court considered that the proceedings against each had determined criminal charges within the meaning of this provision.

Furthermore, in the Coyne v. the United Kingdom judgment (Reports 1997-V) the Court had found a district court-martial convened pursuant to the Air Force Act 1955 to have similar deficiencies and had concluded that the organisational defects were such that they could not be corrected by any subsequent review procedure. Violations had similarly been found in a series of further cases and the Court found no reason to distinguish the present cases. The courts-martial which dealt with the applicants' cases were not independent and impartial and could not guarantee them a fair trial.", "Having reached this conclusion, it was unnecessary to examine further specific complaints about the fairness of the proceedings.", "Conclusion: violation (unanimous).", "Article 41: As the applicants had not responded to the Court's request that they submit their claims for just satisfaction, it was unnecessary to apply this provision.", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the "]}
