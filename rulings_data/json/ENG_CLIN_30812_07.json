The applicant had obtained from the French compensation fund for victims of terrorism and other offences (the CIVI) a significant sum covering both the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage for which Belgium had been found responsible in that judgment.", "Law – Article 41: The Court found reasonable the CIVI’s award in respect of pecuniary damage. As to the non-pecuniary damage and in the circumstances of the case, the Court considered it appropriate to award the applicant an additional EUR 50,000. Noting that the compensation fund would be entitled to ask the applicant to reimburse part of the amount that he had been paid in so far as it corresponded to the amount of the Court’s award, the Court found that it was fair to stipulate that the said amount should not be claimed back from him.", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the ", ""]}
