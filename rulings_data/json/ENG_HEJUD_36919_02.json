The Lithuanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Baltutytė.", "3.  The applicant alleged that the State had failed to fulfil its obligation to secure respect for her family’s private life as a result of the derisory sum of non-pecuniary damages awarded in her husband’s favour, even though a serious violation of the family’s privacy had been committed by a major newspaper. In addition, the applicant claimed a violation of her husband’s right to an effective domestic remedy as the national law imposed a low ceiling on compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by the unlawful public dissemination of information by the mass media about a person’s private life.", "4.  On 7 September 2005 the Court decided to give notice to the Government of the applicant’s complaints under Article 8 of the Convention. On the same date, the Court decided to apply Article 29 § 3 of the Convention and to examine the merits of the complaints at the same time as their admissibility.", "THE FACTS", "I.  THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE", "5.  The applicant’s family lived in the village of Ąžuolpamušio, Pasvalys district. Her husband died on 15 April 2002.", "6.  Prior to his death, on 31 January 2001 the biggest Lithuanian daily newspaper, Lietuvos Rytas, published a front page article entitled “Pasvalys villages paralysed by the fear of death: residents of the remote Lithuanian area shackled by the AIDS threat” (Pasvalio kaimus paralyžavo mirties baimė: nuošalios Lietuvos vietovės gyventojai atsidūrė AIDS grėsmės gniaužtuose). The following statements of particular concern to the applicant’s family were made in the article:", "“Notoriously promiscuous, thirty-year old Gitana Biriuk is already sick with this fatal disease ...", "An HIV-positive person lives in a village in the Pajiešmenys area. This [is] G. Biriuk, an unmarried mother of two children ...", "The father of G. Biriuk’s two children is an inhabitant of Paiešmenių [village] - L. Armonas...", "Medics at the Pasvalys hospital confirmed that G. Biriuk is HIV-positive. The woman was taken to hospital with tuberculosis. Blood tests revealed that she was HIV-positive ...", "The woman [G. Biriuk] has already been diagnosed with AIDS - this is the last stage of the infection. The disease can last from a year up to ten years but finally ends with death...", "Laimis Armonas is HIV-positive...", "Last week ... the father of G. Biriuk’s two children, living in Pajiešmenių village, was taken to Pasvalys hospital with a high fever...", "L. Armonas is another victim of AIDS...", "From the appearance of the patient [reference to L. Armonas] and the symptoms of the disease, the doctors suspected that he might be HIV-positive. The reply recently received from the AIDS centre confirmed the suspicions.”", "7.  The husband instituted proceedings in the Vilnius City Third District Court, suing the newspaper for non-pecuniary damages in the amount of 50,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL, or about 14,460 euro (EUR)) for a breach of his right to privacy.", "8.  On 19 July 2001 the court ruled in his favour. The court found that the defendant had not proved the truthfulness of the published allegations as to the husband’s relationship with G. Biriuk, or that the information about the husband’s state of health, indicating his full name and residence, had been made public with his consent, or met a legitimate public interest in drawing society’s attention to the rising number of HIV cases in Lithuania. Having assessed all the relevant evidence, the court decided that there was no proof that the husband was the father of G. Biriuk’s children. The article humiliated the husband and the publication of information about his private life caused him non-pecuniary damage, had an impact on his health, and a negative influence on his family life and his reputation. It also restricted his family’s opportunities to communicate with others. The court noted that in 2001 the statutory capital of the newspaper company - JSC Lietuvos Rytas - was LTL 33,754,700 (approximately EUR 9,776,037). However, the court concluded that the information had not been made public deliberately, and applied Article 54 § 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public. Accordingly, it awarded the husband the maximum sum set by this Law in such circumstances, i.e. LTL 10,000 (about EUR 2,896), in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.", "9.  The husband appealed to the . On 8 October 2001 the court dismissed the appeal, agreeing with the lower court’s reasoning.", "10.  As mentioned above, the husband died on 15 April 2002.", "11.  On 24 April 2002 the Supreme Court upheld the appellate court’s decision. It stated that an award exceeding the amount of LTL 10,000 set by the aforementioned legislation could be granted if it were established that information had been published intentionally. The court observed that by printing the article the newspaper had committed two violations: first, it had published information which was not true and which debased the husband’s honour and reputation, and, secondly, it had published data about his private life without his consent. However the Supreme Court ruled that the lower courts had come to the well-founded conclusion that the husband had not proved that the defendant had published information about him deliberately and, therefore, there was no ground to increase the amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage fivefold, as envisaged by Article 54 § 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public.", "II.  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE", "12. Article 22 of the Constitution of the  provides as relevant:", "“The private life of a human being shall be inviolable...\nThe law and the courts shall protect everyone from arbitrary or unlawful interference in his private and family life, or from encroachment upon his honour and dignity.“", "13.  Article 30 of the Constitution provides that compensation for material and non-pecuniary damage suffered by a person shall be established by law.", "14.  According to Article 71 of the Civil Code applicable at the material time, concerning compensation for non-pecuniary damage:", "“Mass media, organisations or persons who publish false information degrading the honour and dignity of a person, and also information about a person’s private life without the consent of that person, shall pay compensation for non-pecuniary damage.

The amount of the compensation for non-pecuniary damage may not be in excess of LTL 10,000, except for cases when the court establishes that false information degrading the honour and dignity of a person has been published intentionally.

The rights of the person are protected irrespective of whether the disseminated information degrades his or her honour and dignity.”", "19.  The Ruling further stipulated that the producer or disseminator of public information who publishes information about an individual’s private life without his or her consent must compensate for the non-pecuniary damage caused. When assessing the monetary compensation for such damage, the courts should take into consideration the guilt of the defendant, his or her behaviour after the dissemination of the information, the negative impact on the plaintiff’s professional or social life and the form and manner in which the information was disseminated, as well as its content and other relevant circumstances.

The right to privacy consists essentially in the right to live one’s own life with a minimum of interference. It concerns private, family and home life, physical and moral integrity, honour and reputation, avoidance of being placed in a false light, non-revelation of irrelevant and embarrassing facts ... protection from disclosure of information given or received by the individual confidentially...", "7. The right to privacy afforded by Article 8 of the Convention on Human Rights should not only protect an individual against interference by public authorities, but also against interference by private persons or institutions, including the mass media.

She also argued that the national legislation did not provide an effective remedy from the point of view of Article 8 of the Convention as it limited the maximum amount of non-pecuniary damages for a so-called “unintentional” breach of privacy by the mass media. The applicant relied on Articles 1, 8 and 13 of the Convention.", "23.  From the outset the Court notes that the applicant’s complaint cannot be dealt with under Article 1 of the Convention, which is a framework provision that cannot be breached on its own (see Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v.  [GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 112, ECHR 2001II). Moreover, in the Court’s view, the complaint under Article 13 as to the absence of an effective domestic remedy is subsidiary to the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention that the State did not ensure respect for the private life of the applicant’s family. Therefore the Court finds it appropriate to analyse the applicant’s complaints solely under Article 8 of the Convention, which reads in so far as relevant as follows:", "“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, ....", "2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society ... for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”", "A.  Admissibility", "24.  The Government maintained that the application in the present case had not been lodged by the alleged victim of the Convention violation, namely the applicant’s husband, who had died on 15 April 2002 before the final decision of 24 April 2002 of the Supreme Court. The Government argued that the widow did not have the requisite standing under Article 34 of the Convention and therefore the application must be rejected as being incompatible ratione personae pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.", "25.  The Government also contended that the husband could not have claimed to be a victim of the violation of Article 8 of the Convention as the domestic courts had clearly established the violation of his rights and awarded adequate compensation. Alternatively the Government maintained that the application was manifestly ill-founded.", "26.  The applicant submitted that she had been directly affected by the failure of the State to protect her family’s private life to the same or comparable extent as her late husband. To substantiate her argument, she relied on the reasoning on Vilnius City Third District Court, upheld by the Supreme Court, that the impugned newspaper article had had a negative impact on her family life and her spouse’s reputation, as well having restricted the family’s opportunities to interact with others (paragraph 8 above). Due to the infringement of their rights, the whole family had suffered severe moral and psychological trauma and, among many detrimental consequences, had had to move from their village.", "27.  As to the Government’s argument that the compensation awarded by the domestic courts had been adequate and that the State had fulfilled its positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention, the applicant submitted that the statutory limit on compensation for non-pecuniary damage was the very reason for the violation of the State’s positive obligation and, therefore, there were no grounds to find the application inadmissible.", "28.  The Court observes that in the present case Laimutis Armonas died on 15 April 2002 and that his widow lodged the application with the Court on 2 October 2002.", "29.  The Court recalls that, in certain circumstances, it has struck out of its list cases where it has taken the view that the nature of the complaint did not allow it to be transferred to a relative because it was so closely linked to the person of the deceased that the heirs could not claim to have a sufficient interest to justify the continuation of the examination of the application (see X v. France, judgment of 31 March 1992, Series A no. 234C, p. 11, § 26). However, in the present case the Court considers that the close relatives of Laimutis Armonas, in particular his spouse and their minor child, have an interest of their own to ensure that his right to privacy is respected even if he died before the final domestic decision, as any statement violating this right not only affected the deceased’s reputation but also that of his family (see, mutatis mutandis, Nölkenbockhoff v. Germany, decision of \n12 December 1984, D.R. 40, p. 187, § 4). The Court particularly notes the conclusion of the Vilnius City Third District Court that the article in question restricted the family’s opportunities to communicate with others (paragraph 8 above). Moreover, the family had had to leave their village because of the adverse effects of the newspaper article on their relations with their neighbours (paragraph 26 above). Consequently, the Court is of the opinion that the link between the publication and the deceased is not exclusive and it cannot be claimed that the article had no bearing at all on the person of the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Funke v. France, judgment of 25 February 1993, Series A no. 256A, p. 25). In these circumstances the Court finds that the applicant has standing to bring the present proceedings in her husband’s stead.", "30.  The Court notes the Government’s argument that the husband could not have claimed to be a victim of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention as the domestic courts had clearly established a violation of his right to respect for private life and had awarded appropriate compensation. However, the Court emphasises that a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him or her of the status of a “victim” unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, § 36). The Court recognises that the domestic courts determined the violation of the husband’s right to private and family life. However, the Court finds that the question of victim status as regards the redress for this violation is inextricably linked to the merits of the complaint. Therefore, it considers that both questions should be joined and examined together. The Court also observes that the applicant’s complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It further notes that the complaint is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The applicant’s arguments", "31.   Under Article 8 of the Convention, the applicant complained that the  had failed to fulfil its positive obligation to secure respect for her family’s private life. Article 54 § 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public was inadequate from the point of view of Article 8 of the Convention, as it limited the amount of non-pecuniary damages to LTL 10,000 for an unintentional breach of privacy. Taking into account the financial strength of the newspaper, the existence of such a low limit was conducive towards the violation of her husband’s rights, as it was aware that under no circumstances would it be required to pay large sums in compensation for breaches of this kind. The applicant concluded that this statutory limit could not be deemed a necessary and proportionate means to achieve any of the legitimate aims enumerated in Article 8 § 2 of the Convention.", "2.  The Government’s arguments", "32.  The Government noted that Article 8 does not necessarily require the State to fulfil its positive obligation to secure respect for the private life of a person by the provision of unlimited compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation in determining the measures required for the better implementation of that obligation, as long as the limits on such compensation reasonably correspond to the social importance of the protected values and certain financial standards based on the economic situation of the country. In the Government’s view, when seeking a fair balance between the general interest of the country and the interests of the individual, setting a maximum amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage within a certain period of a State’s life should be acceptable.", "33.  The Government also noted that the new Civil Code which came into force on 1 July 2001 removed the impugned limitation on non-pecuniary damage. Nevertheless, the domestic jurisprudence indicates that current awards rarely exceed the previous maximum of LTL 10,000.", "34. According to the Government, in the present case the courts have recognised that there was no public interest in the publication of information about the husband’s private life, thereby acknowledging the unlawfulness of the newspaper’s actions. Having regard to the examination of all the criteria applicable in similar cases as well as all the relevant circumstances, the courts, and the Supreme Court in particular, had granted the husband a fair sum in compensation.", "3.  The Court’s assessment", "(a)  Applicable principles", "35.  The Court has previously held that the notion of “private life” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention is a broad concept which includes, inter alia, the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings (see Niemietz v. Germany, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 251B, p. 33, § 29). It encompasses elements such as sexual life (see, for example, Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, pp. 18-19, § 41) and, undoubtedly, personal information relating to a patient (see I. v. Finland, no. 20511/03, § 35, 17 July 2008).", "36.  The Court recalls that, although the object of Article 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference. In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in the effective respect for private or family life. These obligations may involve the adoption of measures designed to secure the right even in the sphere of the relations between individuals \n(see Evans v. the  [GC], no. 6339/05, § 75, ECHR 2007...).", "37.  The Court has previously held that whether the case is analysed in terms of a positive duty on the State to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant’s rights under paragraph 1 of Article 8, or in terms of an interference by a public authority to be justified in accordance with paragraph 2, the applicable principles are broadly similar. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole (see Von Hannover v. Germany, no. 59320/00, § 57, ECHR 2004VI). Furthermore, in striking this balance, the aims mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 8 may be of a certain relevance (see Rees v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 17 October 1986, Series A no. 106, § 37).", "38.  The Court reiterates that, as regards such positive obligations, the notion of “respect” is not clear-cut. In view of the diversity of the practices followed and the situations obtaining in the Contracting States, the notion’s requirements will vary considerably from case to case. Accordingly, this is an area in which the Contracting Parties enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention, account being taken of the needs and resources of the community and of individuals (see Johnston and Others v. Ireland, judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112, § 55). The Court nonetheless recalls that Article 8, like any other provision of the Convention or its Protocols, must be interpreted in such a way as to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective \n(see Shevanova v. Latvia, no. 58822/00, § 69, 15 June 2006).", "39.  The protection of private life has to be balanced, among other things, against the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention. In that context the Court emphasises the duty of the press to impart information and ideas on matters of public interest (see, among many authorities, Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30, § 59).  However, the Court notes that a fundamental distinction needs to be made between reporting facts – even if controversial – capable of contributing to a debate in a democratic society and making tawdry allegations about an individual’s private life (see, mutatis mutandis, Von Hannover v. Germany, cited above, § 63).  As to respect for the individual’s private life, the Court reiterates the fundamental importance of its protection in order to ensure the development of every human being’s personality. That protection extends beyond the private family circle to include a social dimension (ibid., § 69).", "40.  More specifically, the Court has previously held that the protection of personal data, not least medical data, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. The above considerations are especially valid as regards the protection of the confidentiality of a person’s HIV status (cf. Council of Europe materials, paragraphs 20-21 above). The disclosure of such data may dramatically affect his or her private and family life, as well as the individual’s social and employment situation, by exposing that person to opprobrium and the risk of ostracism (see Z v. Finland, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997I, §§ 95-96).", "41.  It is in the light of the above considerations that the Court has now to examine whether the State has fulfilled its positive obligation to secure respect for the applicant’s right to respect for private and family life.", "(b)  Application of these general principles to the present case", "42.  The Court notes that the publication of the article about the state of health of the applicant’s husband, namely that he was HIV-positive, as well as the allegation that he was the father of two children by another woman who was also suffering from AIDS (see paragraph 6 above), were of a purely private nature and therefore fell within the protection of Article 8 (see, for example, Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 41). The Court takes particular note of the fact that the family lived not in a city but in a village, which increased the impact of the publication on the possibility that the husband’s illness would be known by his neighbours and his immediate family, thereby causing public humiliation and exclusion from village social life. In this respect the Court sees no reason to depart from the conclusion of the national courts, which acknowledged that there had been interference with the family’s right to privacy.", "43.  The Court will next examine whether there existed a public interest justifying the publication of this kind of information about the applicant’s husband. However, the Court sees no such legitimate interest and agrees with the finding of the Vilnius City Third District Court, which held that making public information about the husband’s state of health, indicating his full name, surname and residence, did not correspond to any legitimate public interest (paragraph 8 above). In the Court’s view, the publication of the article in question, the sole purpose of which was apparently to satisfy the prurient curiosity of a particular readership, cannot be deemed to contribute to any debate of general interest to society (see, among many authorities, Prisma Presse v. France (dec.), nos. 66910/01 and 71612/01, \n1 July 2003). Consequently, given that the balance lay in favour of the individual’s right to privacy, the State had an obligation to ensure that the husband was able effectively to enforce that right against the press.", "44.  Furthermore, the Court attaches particular significance to the fact that, according to the newspaper, the information about the husband’s illness had been confirmed by employees of the AIDS centre. It cannot be denied that publication of such information in the biggest national daily newspaper could have a negative impact on the willingness of others to take voluntary tests for HIV (cf. paragraph 21 above). In this context, it is of special importance that domestic law provides appropriate safeguards to discourage any such disclosures and the further publication of personal data.", "45.  The Court takes into account that the national law at the material time did contain norms protecting the confidentiality of information about the state of health of a person. It has regard to the existence of the judicial guidelines to be followed if the right to privacy of a person has been breached (see paragraphs 12-19 above). The Court also notes that the domestic courts indeed awarded the husband compensation for non-pecuniary damage. However the principal issue is whether the award of LTL 10,000 was proportionate to the damage he sustained and whether the State, in adopting Article 54 § 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public, which limited the amount of such compensation payable by the mass media, fulfilled its positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention.", "46. The Court agrees with the Government that a State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation in deciding what “respect” for private life requires in particular circumstances (cf. Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1996, §§ 62-63, Reports 1996IV; X and Y v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1985, § 24, Series A no. 91). The Court also acknowledges that certain financial standards based on the economic situation of the State are to be taken into account when determining the measures required for the better implementation of the foregoing obligation. The Court likewise takes note of the fact that the Member States of the Council of Europe may regulate questions of compensation for non-pecuniary damage differently, as well as the fact that the imposition of financial limits is not in itself incompatible with a State’s positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention. However, such limits must not be such as to deprive the individual of his or her privacy and thereby empty the right of its effective content.", "47.  The Court recognises that the imposition of heavy sanctions on press transgressions could have a chilling effect on the exercise of the essential guarantees of journalistic freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention (see, among many authorities, Cumpǎnǎ and Mazǎre v. Romania [GC], no. 33348/96, §§ 113-114, ECHR 2004XI). However, in a case of an outrageous abuse of press freedom, as in the present application, the Court finds that the severe legislative limitations on judicial discretion in redressing the damage suffered by the victim and sufficiently deterring the recurrence of such abuses, failed to provide the applicant with the protection that could have legitimately been expected under Article 8 of the Convention. This view is confirmed by the fact that the impugned ceiling on judicial awards of compensation contained in Article 54 § 1 of the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public was repealed by the new Civil Code soon after the events in the present case (see paragraph 33 above).", "48.  In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court rejects the Government’s preliminary objection as to the applicant’s victim status and concludes that the State failed to secure the applicant’s right to respect for her family’s private life.", "There has therefore been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.", "V.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "49.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "50.  The applicant claimed LTL 90,000 (approximately EUR 26,065) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "51.  The Government submitted that this claim was unjustified and excessive.", "52.  The Court considers that the applicant has suffered non-pecuniary damage which is not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, the Court awards the applicant the sum of EUR 6,500 under this head.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "53.  The applicant also claimed LTL 2,000 (approximately EUR 580) for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and before the .", "54.  The Government contested this claim as unsubstantiated and unreasonable.", "55.  However, the Court notes that this sum is covered by the legal aid which the applicant has already received under its legal aid scheme (EUR 850). Consequently, the Court makes no further award under this head.", "C.  Default interest", "56.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT", "1.  Joins to the merits the Government’s objection as to the applicant’s victim status and rejects it unanimously;", "", "2.\tDeclares unanimously the application admissible;", "3.  Holds by six votes to one that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;", "", "4.  Holds by four votes to three", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 6,500 (six thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeable, this sum being converted into the national currency of that State at the rate applicable on the date of settlement;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "5.  Dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicant’s claims for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 25 November 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tSally Dollé\tFrançoise Tulkens\n\tRegistrar\tPresident", "In accordance with Article 45 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 § 2 of the Rules of Court, the separate opinions of Judges Zagrebelsky, Popović and Tsotsoria are annexed to this judgment.", "S.D.\nF.T.", "DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE ZAGREBELSKY", "(Translation)", "I do not agree with the majority of the Chamber that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in the present case for the following reasons.", "1.  There is no doubt that Article 8 of the Convention is applicable in the case, since the publication concerned caused considerable damage to the applicant’s reputation. The Court’s case-law on the matter is clear. The Court has held that a person’s right to protection of his or her reputation is encompassed by Article 8 as part of the right to respect for private life (see, recently, Pfeifer v. Austria, judgment of 15 November 2007). Article 8 may require the adoption of positive measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see Von Hannover v. Germany, no. 59320/00, § 57, ECHR 2004-VI, and Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1505, §§ 61 and 62).", "2.  In the context of a press article, freedom of expression enters into play. Here too the Court has clearly stated on numerous occasions the principles to be taken into account, which may be summarised as follows. The press plays an eminent role in a democratic society. Although it must not overstep certain bounds, regarding in particular the protection of the reputation and rights of others, its duty is nevertheless to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest. Article 10 protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed.", "From Article 8 is derived the right to protection of one’s reputation, even outside the sphere of private life, but the requirements of such protection must be weighed against the interest in free discussion of matters of public interest. The Court must check that the domestic authorities have maintained a fair balance between protection of freedom of expression and protection of the reputation of those against whom allegations have been made.", "There are different ways of securing respect for private life, and the nature of the State’s obligation depends on the aspect of private life concerned. It follows that the choice of measures calculated to secure compliance with that positive obligation falls within the Contracting States’ margin of appreciation.", "The adjective “necessary”, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, implies the existence of a “pressing social need”. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but \n", "that margin goes hand in hand with European supervision. In exercising its supervisory function the Court’s task is not to take the place of the competent domestic courts but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they have taken by virtue of their power of appreciation. The Court must determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the interference were “relevant and sufficient” and whether the measure complained of was “proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued”. The right of journalists to impart information about matters of public interest is protected, provided that they are acting in good faith, on the basis of exact facts, in order to provide “accurate and reliable” information in accordance with the ethics of journalism. The second paragraph of Article 10 emphasises that exercise of the freedom of expression carries with it duties and responsibilities, and those duties and responsibilities may be of some importance where there is a risk of damage to the reputation of a person referred to by name or impairment of the “rights of others”.", "The nature and severity of the penalties imposed on those whose comments give offence are also elements to be taken into consideration in assessing the proportionality of an interference. Although Contracting States have the power, and indeed the duty, by virtue of their positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention, to regulate the exercise of freedom of expression in such a way as to ensure the appropriate protection of the reputation of individuals by law, they must in so doing avoid taking measures likely to dissuade the media from playing their role.", "The civil nature of measures taken against journalists or publishers does not exclude assessment of their “proportionality”, given the condition that they must not have the effect of dissuading the press from taking part in the discussion of matters of public interest. In that connection, “perceptions as to what would be an appropriate response by society to speech which does not or is not claimed to enjoy the protection of Article 10 of the Convention may differ greatly from one  to another. The competent national authorities are better placed than the European Court to assess the matter and should therefore enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in this respect” (see Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 13 July 1995, § 48).", "Excessively large sums in damages and the lack of appropriate and effective safeguards against disproportionate awards may lead the Court to find a violation of Article 10 (see Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 50 and 51, and Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 February 2005, § 96).", "3.  It was accepted by the domestic courts that there had been abuse of the freedom of expression and damage to the reputation of the applicant’s husband in the present case. It is not for the Court to take those courts’ place in determining whether or not the wrong done was intentional within the meaning of domestic law. What is important is the finding that the first condition for protection of the husband’s right to defend his reputation was met by the domestic courts. Those courts also upheld his right to damages, equivalent to 2,896 euros, which was the maximum sum they could have awarded under the legislation in force at the time, which indeed fixed a ceiling with the evident intention of preventing exorbitant awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "To my mind, the mere fact that there was a ceiling should not cause any problem; on the contrary, I would say, the aim was to protect freedom of expression from possible interference stemming from judicial decisions relating to a question – non-pecuniary damage – which by its nature leaves wide latitude to judges. Naturally, the ceiling must be reasonable, but from that point of view what is decisive is the maximum figure concerned, and above all the result of the ceiling’s application.", "4.  On the one hand, the exclusion of disproportionate awards of damages is prompted by the need to avoid interfering with freedom of expression. On the other hand, an order to pay an insignificant level of compensation might constitute failure to protect the victim’s right to respect for his or her private life (although it may sometimes be sufficient simply to recognise the fact that there has been an unjustified attack on the reputation of the person concerned). Except in extreme cases at one end of the spectrum or the other, I find it difficult to accept that the Court should substitute its assessment for that of the domestic courts and, through its judgment, intervene in substance to correct their decisions.", "5.  In the present case the amount of 2,896 euros – awarded as compensation for non-pecuniary damage – does not seem so disproportionate as to enable the Court to find that the applicant’s right was not protected at national level. Unlike the practice in Article 10 cases, in a case concerning Article 8 consideration of the economic power of the opponent does not seem relevant, since it is not a question of punitive damages but of assessing the damage actually suffered by the applicant.", "In a recent case concerning a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, in which the domestic courts had given priority to freedom of expression over protection of the applicant’s right to defend his reputation (and in which he therefore had lost his case and received nothing in damages) the Court, in applying Article 41 of the Convention, awarded the applicant 5,000 euros (see Pfeifer v. Austria, cited above). While I accept that each case is different, I think that at least that case may serve to provide an approximate calibration, and lead the Court to the conclusion that the amount awarded by the Lithuanian courts, pursuant to the legislation in force, can reasonably be taken to cover the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant’s family and that, in any event, the domestic decisions gave the family appropriate protection.", "PARTLY dissenting opinion of Judges Popović and Tsotsoria", "We voted against the amount awarded to the applicant in just satisfaction, because we consider it to be excessive in respect of the violation found. We believe that, in the light of the balancing test between the fundamental rights protected under Articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, rightly referred to in the Judgment, the applicant should be awarded a lesser sum."]}
