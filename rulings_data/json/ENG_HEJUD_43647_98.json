Following registration of the petitions ..., they are transferred ...to the competent chambers.", "2. ...", "3.  A rapporteur appointed by the president of the chamber in administrative courts examines the petitions:", "a) Jurisdiction and Competence", "...", "...the examination of the petitions should be concluded at the latest within fifteen days of receiving the petition...", "5. If the preliminary examination does not reveal any illegality, the notification procedure shall be undertaken...”", "THE LAW", "I.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION", "37.  The applicants complained that the length of the compensation proceedings exceeded the “reasonable time” requirement under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The relevant part of Article 6 § 1 provides as follows:", "“ 1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations..., everyone is entitled to a...hearing within a reasonable time by [a] tribunal established by law...”", "", "38.  The Court notes that the period to be taken into consideration in determining whether the proceedings satisfied the “reasonable time” requirement laid down by Article 6 § 1 began on 15 April 1992 when the applicants filed their action with the Ankara Administrative Court and ended on 10 March 1998 when the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. The period under consideration thus lasted five years and ten months before three instances. ", "39.  The Government submitted that the case was complicated as the domestic courts had to investigate the truth of the allegations, the occupation of the deceased and his income and whether the family had any other income. The Government contended that the applicants prolonged the proceedings by lodging an application with the  when they should have applied to the  pursuant to the provisions of domestic law. They pointed out that the applicants further prolonged the proceedings by not paying the exact amount of the court fees on at least two occasions. Moreover, the proceedings before administrative courts were mainly written and it was time-consuming to collect documents from the relevant authorities. The Government concluded that there was no excessive delay attribuable to the administration or the judicial authorities.", "40.  The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many others, Sekin and Others v. Turkey, no. 26518/95, § 35, 22 January 2004, and Kranz v. Poland, no. 6214/02, § 33, 17 February 2004). ", "41.  As regards the complexity of the case, the Court does not consider that the case presented any exceptional legal or factual difficulties since the impugned proceedings concerned an action for compensation in respect of the loss sustained by the applicants as a result of the death of A. O. The mere fact that the domestic courts had to investigate the truth of the applicants' allegations is not in itself sufficient to conclude that the case was complex. ", "42.  As regards the conduct of the applicants, the Court considers that the applicants contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings by lodging an action for compensation with the wrong court despite the provisions of domestic law. However, it observes that, according to Article 14 of the Administrative Procedure Code, a preliminary examination of whether a petition has been filed with a competent court is examined ex officio by the domestic administrative court within fifteen days of the transfer of the petition to the relevant chamber of that court. The Court points out that, in the present case, it took the  Administrative Court one year and ten months to take a decision of incompetence ratione loci after the petition had been submitted to it. ", "43.  Even assuming that the incompetence ratione loci of the court only became apparent following the submission of the observations of the parties, the Court observes that the case lay dormant before the  for one year, four months and twenty-four days. In these circumstances, it cannot be concluded that the applicants were responsible for the totality of this delay. In respect of the down payment of the court fees, the Court considers that the applicants were responsible for the prolongation of the proceedings by about five months between 21 February and 10 August 1994 and by one month between 30 July and 27 September 1996.", "44.  As to the conduct of the domestic authorities, while the Court notes that the 's conduct was not beyond reproach, it does not find that the proceedings before this instance warrant a conclusion that there were unreasonable delays in the processing of the case. Nor does it find that there were any excessive delays before the . However, the Court considers that the period of one year and ten months before the  was unreasonable. The Court notes that, apart from stating that the applicants contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings by filing a petition with the wrong court, the Government's observations do not explain this period of inactivity. ", "45.  Finally, the Court considers that what was at stake for the applicants in the domestic litigation was of considerable importance to them. ", "46.  Consequently, the Court finds that, in the particular circumstances of the instant case and, having regard to the fact that it took one year and ten months for the Ankara Administrative Court to reach a decision of incompetence ratione loci, the “reasonable time” requirement laid down in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was not complied with. ", "47.  There has, accordingly, been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "48.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "49.  The Court points out that under Rule 60 of the Rules of Court any claim for just satisfaction must be itemised and submitted in writing together with the relevant supporting documents or vouchers, “failing which the Chamber may reject the claim in whole or in part”.", "50.  In the instant case, on 4 December 2003, after the application was declared admissible, the applicants were requested to submit their claims for just satisfaction. They did not submit any such claims within the specified timelimit.", "51.  In view of the above, the Court makes no award under Article 41 of the Convention.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 21 December 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tS.
