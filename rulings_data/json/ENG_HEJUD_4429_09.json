A suspect tells me his version of events and then a police officer dictates to me the suspect’s defence formulated in a comprehensible manner and I type it. A police officer asks the suspect questions. When a written record is completed it is given to a suspect to read and he signs it. The same method is used when a lawyer is present. Where a written record of questioning shows that a lawyer was present and a lawyer has signed the record it means that he was present from the beginning until the end of the questioning.", "To a question from the defence lawyer I can answer that now when I see the written record of the defendant’s questioning of 2 November 2005, I cannot explain why there is no mention of the time when the defence lawyer arrived.", "To a question from the judge I can say that all information and the name of a defence lawyer and the time of his arrival are dictated to me by a police officer conducting the questioning and who also signs the record.

Their statements as regards the usual method of the questioning of suspects are concordant and mutually corroborated, which leads this court to conclude that there is no reason not to believe them that at the end of the questioning a written record is read out to the parties and they sign it or that the record is given to the parties to read it if they wish to.", "... information has been obtained from the Fifth Police Station that the defendant was questioned on 9 November 2005, as shown by the evidence that the defendant was [on that day] taken out of detention, and the mention of 2 November 2005 in the written record was an error. This however does not indicate that the defendant’s objection that the questioning was not conducted in accordance with the law is well founded because it has not been put in doubt, and the court finds this objection unfounded and aimed at avoiding the defendant’s criminal responsibility.", "As regards the written record of the defendant’s questioning on 20 June 2007... this court heard evidence from S.S., R.Ð. and I.K.", "[statements given by these witnesses are then reproduced]", "This court accepts the statement by witness [S.]S. as true because it has not been put in doubt. It also accepts the statements of witnesses R.Ð. and I.K. finding that there is no reason not to believe them because they are State officials who have a duty to act in accordance with the law and know the laws well, and it is understandable that witness [I.]K. could not remember the details of the defendant’s questioning owing to the passage of time and the numerous interviews he conducts daily. Since this evidence was truthful and logical, this court finds that there is no reason not to believe them, that is to say their statement that after the written record is completed it is given to the parties to read and sign.", "In view of the above, this court deems unfounded the defendant’s defence given at the trial, where he said that he had not read the written record of his questioning by the Zagreb Police, and that that record had not been read out to him so that he had not known the content of the record, as well as that he had signed the record under duress and only in order to be released. ...", "Therefore this court finds the defendant’s defence given at the trial unconvincing. It is necessary to stress that in his defence given to the police the defendant said that he had stolen some items but denied taking money from wallets, although the latter was established as fact from the evidence given by the injured parties at the trial. Had the police officers falsified the written record of his questioning, as suggested by the defendant, then they would surely also have mentioned the taking of the money according to the complaints of the injured parties. Contrary to this, the written record states that the defendant did not take any money, which clearly shows that the police officers did not impute anything to the defendant ...”", "139.  In addition, his detention was extended until 19 June 2009, under Article 102 § 1(3) (fear of reoffending) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the same reasoning as before.", "140.  On 16 and 20 March 2009 respectively the applicant and his defence lawyer lodged their separate appeals against a decision extending the applicant’s detention.

It was recorded that lawyer E.Č. arrived at 12.30 p.m. and that the questioning ended on 1.30 p.m. on 2 November 2005.", "145.  As regards the applicant’s questioning on 20 June 2007, they argued that lawyer S.S. had stated that the questioning had lasted for about an hour.

The Convention does not lay down for the Contracting States any given manner for ensuring within their internal law the effective implementation of the Convention. The choice as to the most appropriate means of achieving this is in principle a matter for the domestic authorities, who are in continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries and are better placed to assess the possibilities and resources afforded by their respective domestic legal systems (see Swedish Engine Drivers’ Union v. Sweden, 6 February 1976, § 50, Series A no. 20; Chapman v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27238/95, § 91, ECHR 2001-I; and Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia [GC], no. 60654/00, § 90, ECHR 2007-II).", "172.  In accordance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, the Court may only deal with a matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted. The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, for example, Hentrich v. France, 22 September 1994, § 33, Series A no. 296-A, and Remli v. France, 23 April 1996, § 33, Reports 1996-II). Thus, the complaint submitted to the Court must first have been made to the appropriate national courts, at least in substance, in accordance with the formal requirements of domestic law and within the prescribed time-limits. To hold otherwise would not be compatible with the subsidiary character of the Convention system (see Gavril Yosifov v. Bulgaria, no. 74012/01, § 42, 6 November 2008). Nevertheless, the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires only that an applicant make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances (see Balogh v. Hungary, no. 47940/99, § 30, 20 July 2004, and John Sammut and Visa Investments Limited v. Malta (dec.), no. 27023/03, 28 June 2005).", "(b)  Application of these principles in the present case", "173.  The Court notes that in its decision of 17 March 2009, case nos. U-III/4182/2008 and U-III/678/2009, the  established that the remedies under the Execution of Prison Sentences Act, namely a complaint to a judge responsible for the execution of sentences, applied equally to convicted prisoners and to persons in detention on remand.", "174.  Furthermore, in the same decision the  itself found a violation of the right of a detained person not to be exposed to inhuman and degrading treatment as regards the prison conditions in Zagreb Prison, the same one where the applicant is placed. Owing to the conditions the  found to be in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, it ordered the immediate release of the person concerned, who then had the right to seek compensation from the State.", "175.  In its judgment Peša v. Croatia (no. 40523/08, 8 April 2010) the Court accepted that the findings of the Constitutional Court together with a possibility of seeking compensation from the State deprived the applicant in that case of his victim status in connection with his complaint about the conditions in Zagreb Prison under Article 3 of the Convention.", "176.  The Court thus finds that, irrespective of the overcrowding of Zagreb Prison, individual measures are available under the national law and that therefore the available remedies have to be exhausted.", "177.   The Court notes that the applicant failed to submit his complaint about the prison conditions to a judge responsible for the execution of sentences or to the prison administration and in the case of an unfavourable outcome he could have used further available remedies, including a constitutional complaint in this respect (see Peša v. Croatia, cited above, §§ 78-80). He therefore, contrary to the principle of subsidiarity, failed to afford the national authorities the possibility of remedying the situation he has complained of to the Court.", "178.  It follows that this complaint must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION", "179.  The applicant complained that on 19 June 2008 the statutory maximum period for his detention had expired and that his detention after that date had been unlawfully and arbitrarily extended, contrary to Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, the relevant part of which reads:", "“1.  Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:", "(a)  the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;", "...", "(c)  the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;", "...”", "A.  Admissibility", "180.  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3(a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The parties’ arguments", "181.  The applicant argued that the pre-trial detention ordered against him in both sets of criminal proceedings at issue should be viewed as a whole and that already on 19 June 2008 the maximum period of pre-trial detention allowed under national law had expired.", "182.  The Government argued that the detention from 19 June 2007 to 19 June 2008 had been ordered in connection with the criminal proceedings conducted under case file no. 2403/07 and that the maximum period of detention expired on 19 June 2008 when the judge presiding over the trial in these proceedings ordered the applicant’s immediate release. However, he had remained in detention on the basis of a detention order issued in the context of the other set of criminal proceedings against him, conducted under case file no. 3257/05. In respect of this detention order the maximum statutory period of detention had not expired.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "(a)  General principles", "183.  The Court first observes that this case falls to be examined under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1, since the purpose of the detention was to bring him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence.", "184.   The Court reiterates that Article 5 of the Convention guarantees the fundamental right to liberty and security. That right is of primary importance in a “democratic society” within the meaning of the Convention (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. , 18 June 1971, § 65, Series A no. 12, and Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, § 37, Series A no. 33). Its key purpose is to prevent arbitrary or unjustified deprivations of liberty (see McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, § 30, ECHR 2006-... and Ladent v. , no. 11036/03, § 45, ECHR 2008... (extracts)).", "185.  All persons are entitled to the protection of that right, that is to say, not to be deprived or continue to be deprived of their liberty (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, 2 March 1987, § 40, Series A no. 114), save in accordance with the conditions specified in paragraph 1 of Article 5. The list of exceptions set out in Article 5 § 1 is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, § 42, Reports 1996-III; Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 170, ECHR 2000-IV; and Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, § 170, ECHR 2004-II).", "186.  The Court reiterates that the expressions “lawful” and “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” in Article 5 § 1 essentially refer back to national law and enshrine the obligation to conform to substantive and procedural rules thereof. Although it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, under Article 5 § 1 failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention and the Court can and should review whether this law has been complied with (see, among many other authorities, Benham v. the United Kingdom, 10 June 1996, § 41, Reports 1996-III, and Assanidze v. Georgia, cited above, § 171).", "187.  This primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law but also relates to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all the Articles of the Convention (see Stafford, cited above, § 63, and Kafkaris, cited above, § 116). “Quality of the law” in this sense implies that where a national law authorises deprivation of liberty it must be sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable in its application, in order to avoid all risk of arbitrariness (see Amuur v. France, 25 June 1996, § 50, Reports 1996-III; Nasrulloyev v. Russia, no. 656/06, § 71, 11 October 2007; and Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, § 76, 9 July 2009). The standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention thus requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, § 54, Reports 1998-VII, and Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, § 52, ECHR 2000-III).", "188.  Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 § 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see, among many other authorities, Winterwerp, cited above § 37; Amuur, cited above, § 50; and Witold Litwa v. Poland, no. 26629/95, § 78, ECHR 2000-III). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 § 1 and the notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, § 67, ECHR 2008-... ).", "(b)  Application of these principles in the present case", "189.  In the instant case, the Court will first consider whether the applicant’s detention was “lawful” and effected “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”, as required by Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. It notes that the first detention order was issued on 20 November 2006. However, the applicant was not placed in detention pursuant to that order but remained at large. The order was not served on the applicant because he was considered to be of an unknown address. As long as the applicant was at large this detention order could not come into effect.", "190.  The applicant was arrested on 19 June 2007 in connection with a different set of criminal proceedings pending against him before the same Municipal Court, also on charges on theft. A second detention order was issued on the same day and the applicant was placed in pre-trial detention pursuant to that second detention order, which thus immediately came into effect.", "191.  The first detention order, issued on 20 November 2006, was served on the applicant’s defence counsel on 17 March 2008. However, it did not come into effect as long as the detention order of 19 June 2007, although issued later, remained in effect.", "192.  Despite the fact that only one of these two detention orders was in effect, a situation was nevertheless created where two different detention orders were issued in respect of the applicant in parallel criminal proceedings pending against him before the same court, all on charges of different counts of theft or aggravated theft.", "193.  When on 19 June 2008 the statutory maximum period for the applicant’s detention under the detention order, issued on 19 June 2007, expired, the judge conducting the criminal proceedings in connection with which this order had been issued, gave a decision stating that the maximum statutory period of detention had been reached and ordered the applicant’s immediate release. However, the applicant was not released because the detention order issued on 20 November 2006 then immediately came into effect.", "194.  Turning to the relevant provisions of the applicable domestic law, the Court notes that the Code of Criminal Procedure contains no explicit provision regulating such a situation. While section 109 governs statutory maximum periods of detention for different offences, depending on the sentence prescribed, it contains no provisions concerning the maximum detention period on the basis of detention orders adopted in parallel criminal proceedings.", "195.  Furthermore, although the Government were explicitly asked to provide the Supreme Court’s practice regarding the situation at issue, they have not submitted any such material. The Court therefore concludes that the lack of statutory regulation has not been remedied by the practice of the Supreme Court.", "196.  The absence of any statutory regulation of such a situation and any relevant practice of the Croatian Supreme Court leaves open the possibility for the applicable legislation on the maximum statutory periods of detention to be circumvented.", "197.   The Court considers that to detain a person after the maximum statutory period for his detention has expired, on the basis of a detention order issued in parallel criminal proceedings, without such detention being based on a specific statutory provision or clear judicial practice, is incompatible with the principle of legal certainty and arbitrary, and runs counter to the fundamental aspects of the rule of law.", "198.  The Court accordingly finds that the applicant’s detention between 19 June 2008 and 10 March 2009 was unlawful, in breach of the provisions of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.", "III.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 § 3 OF THE CONVENTION", "199.  The applicant complained about the grounds for his detention and the inefficient conduct of the proceedings by the national courts. He relied on Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, the relevant part of which reads:", "“Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.”", "A.  Admissibility", "1.  Detention in connection with the criminal proceedings conducted under nos. 219/06; 2965/06; 2403/07; and 824/08", "200.  The Court notes that in these proceedings the applicant was arrested on 19 June 2007 and placed in pre-trial detention. On 11 December 2007 he was found guilty and sentenced to one year and three months’ imprisonment.", "201.  The first-instance judgment was partly quashed on 4 March 2008 and the case was in that part remitted to the first-instance court, which delivered a fresh judgment on 3 April 2009. However, in the meantime, on 19 June 2008 the applicant’s detention in connection with these proceedings was terminated.", "202.  The present application was lodged with the Court on 25 March 2009, that is to say more than six months after the applicant’s pre-trial detention had ended.", "203.  It follows that all complaints concerning the applicant’s detention in connection with the proceedings at issue have been introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.", "2.  Detention in connection with the criminal proceedings conducted under nos. 2730/07 and 3257/05", "204.  The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3(a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The parties’ arguments", "205.  The applicant argued that the national courts had repeatedly relied on the same grounds for ordering and extending his detention without taking into account new developments and that the conduct of the proceedings by the national courts was not in accordance with the requirements of Article  5 § 3 of the Convention.", "206.  The Government argued that the reasons put forward by the national authorities for ordering and extending the applicant’s detention had been relevant and sufficient and thoroughly explained.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "207.  The Court notes that the issue to be examined under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention is whether the grounds relied on by the national authorities in the order for the applicant’s detention of 20 November 2006, which came into effect on 19 June 2008, and in all subsequent decisions extending his detention, were relevant and sufficient. However, the Court notes that it has already found that the applicant’s detention after 19 June 2008 was arbitrary and in contravention of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. That finding makes it redundant for the Court to further examine whether the grounds for such detention were relevant and sufficient.", "208.  Against that background and in view of the violation found under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, the Court finds that it is not necessary to examine further any complaint under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.", "III.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 § 4 OF THE CONVENTION", "209.  The applicant further complained that the proceedings concerning his constitutional complaints against the detention orders issued against him had not met the requirements of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "“Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.”", "A.  Admissibility", "210.  The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3(a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The parties’ arguments", "211.  The applicant argued that the  had not examined three of his constitutional complaints on the merits only because, in the meantime, a fresh decision extending his detention had been adopted. He further argued that the national courts had never addressed his complaint that his detention after 19 June 2008 had been unlawful because the statutory maximum period had expired.", "212.  The Government maintained that the applicant’s detention had been frequently reviewed by the competent courts of their own motion and that the applicant had also had the possibility under domestic law of applying for his detention order to be lifted. The applicant had always been able to lodge an appeal with the Zagreb County Court against each decision extending his detention and his appeals had been speedily decided on.", "213.  The applicant had also lodged several constitutional complaints. Pursuant to section 32 of the Constitutional Court Act, the  did not examine the merits of constitutional complaints against decisions which were no longer in effect at the time when it came to examine the complaints.", "214.  As regards the complaint that the national courts had not addressed the applicant’s arguments concerning the lawfulness of his detention after 19 June 2008, the Government contended that the proceedings before the Constitutional Court fell outside the scope of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention because the Constitutional Court was not a “court” within the meaning of that provision.", "215.  Furthermore, the applicant’s constitutional complaint of 22 July 2008 had been lodged only two days before a fresh decision extending the applicant’s detention had been adopted.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "216.  At the outset the Court reiterates that in a number of its decisions and judgments concerning Croatia it has already examined various issues about the fairness of the proceedings before the Constitutional Court as well as issues concerning the rights guaranteed under Article 5 of the Convention (see, for example, Janković v.  (dec.), no. 43440/98, ECHR 2000X; Olujić v. , no. 22330/05, §§ 36 and 37, 5 February 2009; Oršuš and Others v.  [GC], no. 15766/03, §§ 108- 110, ECHR 2010...; Peša v. Croatia, no. 40523/08, §§ 112-126, 8 April 2010; and Hađi v. Croatia, no. 42998/08, §§ 43-47, 1 July 2010). The Court does not see any reason to deviate from this case-law in the circumstances of the present case.", "(a)  Inadmissibility of the applicant’s constitutional complaints", "(i)  General principles", "217.  The Court reiterates that the purpose of Article 5 § 4 is to assure to persons who are arrested and detained the right to judicial supervision of the lawfulness of the measure to which they are thereby subjected (see, mutatis mutandis, De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, 18 June 1971, § 76, Series A no. 12, and Ismoilov and Others v. Russia, no. 2947/06, § 145, 24 April 2008). A remedy must be made available during a person’s detention to allow that person to obtain speedy judicial review of the lawfulness of the detention, capable of leading, where appropriate, to his or her release. The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 § 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see, mutatis mutandis, Stoichkov v. Bulgaria, no. 9808/02, § 66 in fine, 24 March 2005, and Vachev v. Bulgaria, no. 42987/98, § 71, ECHR 2004VIII). The accessibility of a remedy implies, inter alia, that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy (see, mutatis mutandis, Čonka v. , no. 51564/99, §§ 46 and 55, ECHR 2002I).", "(ii)  Application of these principles in the present case", "218.  The Court firstly notes that under the relevant domestic law, after an indictment has been lodged, detention must be judicially reviewed every two months. The Court notes that in the present case the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention was considered by the Zagreb County Court and the  on many occasions.", "219.  However, three of the applicant’s constitutional complaints were not examined on the merits. Thus, the constitutional complaint of 22 July 2008 was declared inadmissible on 21 October 2008; the constitutional complaint of 17 December 2008 was declared inadmissible on 19 February 2009; and the constitutional complaint of 17 April 2009 was declared inadmissible on 8 July 2009, each time on the ground that the impugned decision was no longer in effect since, in the meantime, a fresh decision extending detention had been adopted. The Court therefore has to address the question of the compliance of the above-mentioned Constitutional Court’s decisions with the requirements of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention.", "220.  In this connection the Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, Article 5 § 4 enshrines, as does Article 6 § 1, the right of access to a court, which can only be subject to reasonable limitations that do not impair its very essence (see Shishkov v. Bulgaria, no. 38822/97, §§ 82-90, ECHR 2003-I, and Bochev, cited above, § 70).", "221.  Furthermore, Article 5 § 4 does not compel the Contracting States to set up a second level of jurisdiction for the examination of applications for release from detention. Nevertheless, a State which institutes such a system must in principle accord detainees the same guarantees on appeal as at first instance (see Toth v. Austria, 12 December 1991, § 84, Series A no. 224; Rutten v. the Netherlands, no. 32605/96, § 53, 24 July 2001; Lanz v. Austria, no. 24430/94, § 42, 31 January 2002; and Svipsta v. Latvia, no. 66820/01, § 129, ECHR 2006III). The Court considers that the same applies in a system which provides for a constitutional complaint against decisions ordering and extending detention.", "222.  However, the Croatian system, although allowing for a constitutional complaint, leaves it to the  to await a fresh decision on extension of detention and then to declare the complaint against the previous decision on detention inadmissible. Thus, although the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against three above-mentioned decisions of the Zagreb County Court, the  did not decide on the merits of any of these complaints but declared them all inadmissible because each time a fresh decision on the applicant’s detention had been adopted in the meantime.", "223.  In the Court’s opinion, the Constitutional Court’s failure to decide on the applicant’s constitutional complaints on the merits made it impossible to ensure the proper and meaningful functioning of the system for the review of his detention, as provided for by the national law. By declaring the applicant’s constitutional complaints inadmissible simply because a fresh decision extending his detention had been adopted in the meantime, the Constitutional Court did not satisfy the requirement “that the circumstances voluntarily created by the authorities must be such as to afford applicants a realistic possibility of using the remedy” (see Peša v. Croatia, no. 40523/08, § 126, 8 April 2010, and Hađi v. Croatia, no. 42998/08, § 47, 1 July 2010). Thus, that court fell short of its obligation under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention to review the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention. There has accordingly been a violation of that provision.", "(b)  Failure of the appeal court and the  to respond to the applicant’s arguments", "224.  The Court reiterates that arrested or detained persons are entitled to a review bearing upon the procedural and substantive conditions which are essential for the “lawfulness”, in the sense of the Convention, of their deprivation of liberty. This means that the competent court has to examine “not only compliance with the procedural requirements set out in [domestic law] but also the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the arrest and the legitimacy of the purpose pursued by the arrest and the ensuing detention” (see the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, 29 November 1988, § 65, Series A no. 145-B, and Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, § 58, ECHR 1999II).", "225.  Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that in his appeal of 1 September 2008, and in his constitutional complaint of 21 September 2008, both lodged in respect of the decision by the Zagreb Municipal Court of 29 August 2008 extending his detention, the applicant, relying on Article 5 of the Convention, argued that the statutory maximum period for his detention had expired already on 19 June 2008 and that the conduct of the criminal proceedings against him by the lower court had fallen short of the requirement of efficiency.", "226.  He put forward these same arguments in his appeal of 16 October 2008 and his constitutional complaint of 5 November 2008, both in respect of a decision by the Zagreb Municipal Court of 10 October 2008 extending his detention.", "227.  He repeated the same arguments also in his appeal of 15 January 2009 and his constitutional complaint of 30 January 2009, both in respect of a decision by the Municipal Court of 12 January 2009 extending his detention.", "228.  However, although in each of these instances both the Zagreb County Court on appeal and the  examined the applicant’s appeals and constitutional complaints on the merits, they never made any comments on the above-stated arguments concerning the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention.", "229.  While Article 5 § 4 of the Convention does not impose an obligation on a judge examining an appeal against detention to address every argument contained in the appellant’s submissions, its guarantees would be deprived of their substance if the judge, relying on domestic law and practice, could treat as irrelevant, or disregard, concrete facts invoked by the detainee and capable of putting in doubt the existence of the conditions that are essential for the “lawfulness”, in the sense of the Convention, of the deprivation of liberty (see Nikolova, cited above, § 61, and Farhad Aliyev v. , no. 37138/06, § 209, 9 November 2010).", "230.  The applicant’s submissions in the above-mentioned appeals and constitutional complaints contained arguments connected with his rights guaranteed under Article 5 of the Convention, namely that the statutory maximum period for his detention had expired on 19 June 2008 and that the lower courts had failed to conduct the proceedings with the requisite speediness. These arguments did not appear implausible or frivolous. By not taking these submissions into account the appeal court and the Constitutional Court failed to provide judicial review of the scope and nature required by Article 5 § 4 of the Convention.", "231.  There has therefore been a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention also in the above respect.", "IV.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 §§ 1 and 3(c) OF THE CONVENTION", "232.  The applicant further complained that on two occasions he had been questioned by the police without the presence of a defence lawyer and that his trial had been unfair because his conviction had been based to a decisive degree on the confession he had made to the police. He relied on Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention, the relevant part of which reads:", "“1.  In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ...", "3.  Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:", "...", "(c)  to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;", "...”", "A.  Admissibility", "1.  As regards the applicant’s questioning by the police on 20 June 2007", "233.  The Court notes that the applicant was arrested on 19 June 2007 at 9.30 p.m. in order to be interviewed by the police in connection with twenty-five counts of theft. However, the record of his questioning states that it started on 20 June 2007 at 3 p.m. At a hearing held on 22 September 2008 the applicant also stated that he had been questioned on the second day after his arrest, without specifying the time of his questioning. In his later statements and appeals the applicant repeatedly stated that he had been questioned by the police on 20 June 2007 without the presence of a defence lawyer. In support of his arguments he claimed that the lawyer S.S. had said that the questioning lasted about an hour, but in the applicant’s view this could not have been sufficient for him to consult with a lawyer and give his defence orally in respect of twenty-five counts of theft and for the police officer to dictate and the typist to type the written record of his questioning.", "234.  However, the applicant never explained what, according to him, was the exact duration and manner of his questioning.", "235.  Furthermore, the lawyer S.S. expressly said that he had been present during the entire questioning on 20 June 2007, which had lasted for about an hour.", "236.  In these circumstances the Court finds that the applicant’s complaint that on 20 June 2007 he had been questioned by the police without the presence of defence counsel is insufficiently substantiated.", "237.  Thus, in the light of all the material in its possession the Court finds that this part of the application does not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols.", "238.  It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3(a) and 4 of the Convention.", "2.  As regards the applicant’s questioning by the police on 9 November 2005", "(a)  Exhaustion of domestic remedies", "(i)  The parties’ arguments", "239.  The Government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies because he had not lodged a complaint against the police officers in question, including a criminal complaint, or a complaint to the Croatian Bar Association in respect of the lawyers concerned.", "240.  The applicant maintained that he had exhausted all domestic remedies available in the context of the criminal proceedings against him.", "(ii)  The Court’s assessment", "241.  The Court points to the general principles as stated in paragraphs 173 and 174 above.", "242.  The Court further notes that in respect of all issues pertaining to the fairness of criminal proceedings the defendants may lodge an appeal with an appeal court and a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment. In its judgment in Maresti v. Croatia (no. 55759/07, §§ 23-28, 25 June 2009) the Court accepted that such a request was a remedy to be exhausted, where it was allowed under the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, on the same grounds as those that an applicant is presenting before the Court. The relevant part of that judgment reads:", "“23.  The Court firstly observes that the actual name given to the proceedings in the domestic legal system or the fact that the national jurisdictions have considered them as an extraordinary remedy cannot be considered determinant: what is decisive is the nature and the scope of the proceedings at issue (see San Leonard Band Club v. Malta, no. 77562/01, § 41, ECHR 2004-IX). Furthermore, it is the Court’s well-established practice that the proceedings following an appeal on points of law or an appeal for cassation fall within the scope of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see, for example, H.E. v. Austria, no. 33505/96, §§ 14 and 18, 11 July 2002, and Cobianchi v.  (no. 1), no. 43434/98, §§ 8 and 11, 9 November 2000).", "...", "25.  ... As to the nature of the proceedings following a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment in a criminal case, the Court observes that the Croatian Supreme Court may, if it finds the request well-founded, quash the lower courts’ judgments and remit the case, or in certain cases even decide the case itself. The reasons justifying extraordinary review of a final judgment are expressly enumerated in Article 427 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and are not subject to any discretionary decision of the court. The remedy is available only to the defendant (not to the prosecution) for strictly limited errors of law that operate to the defendant’s detriment and is subject to a strict one-month time limit following the service of the judgment on the defendant.", "26.  The request for extraordinary review has its equivalent in civil proceedings in the form of an appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court (revizija), which is also lodged against a final judgment. In this connection, the Court notes that it has already found that Article 6 is applicable to proceedings concerning such an appeal (see Debelić v. Croatia, no. 2448/03, §§ 21 and 22, 26 May 2005). As to the criminal-law remedy at issue, the Court has in a previous case (Kovač v. Croatia (no. 503/05, 12 July 2007)) taken into consideration proceedings before the Supreme Court concerning a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment by a defendant in a criminal case.", "27.  ... The Court notes that the applicant’s request was made on one of the prescribed grounds for finding an infringement of the Criminal Code ...”", "243.  As regards the present case, the Court notes that the applicant lodged an appeal against the first-instance judgment of the Zagreb Municipal Court. After his appeal had been dismissed by the Zagreb County Court, the applicant lodged a request for an extraordinary review of a final judgment with the Supreme Court.", "244.  In his request for an extraordinary review, the applicant complained that his statements given to the police on two occasions constituted unlawful evidence because he had been questioned without the presence of a lawyer and that, as such, those statements should not have been used by the trial court. In this connection the Court notes that one of the grounds under Article 427 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, together with Article 367(2) and Article 9 of the same Code, for lodging such a request exists when a conviction has been based on unlawfully obtained evidence, and that this was exactly the applicant’s claim.", "245.  In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the proceedings following the request for extraordinary review of the final judgment were decisive for the determination of a criminal charge against the applicant and so fall within the scope of Article 6 § 1 and that the applicant has properly exhausted regular domestic remedies that were available in the context of the criminal proceedings against him. He, therefore, did not need to exhaust any further remedies. Accordingly, the Government’s objection must be dismissed.", "246.  The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3(a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The parties’ submissions", "247.  The applicant argued that he had been questioned by the police without the assistance of a lawyer and that his confession thus obtained had been fabricated by the police. Despite the fact that he had repeatedly complained about that situation before the national courts, showing that the lawyer E.Č. had not been present at his questioning by the police, as was apparent from the discrepancy between the time when the police record had been drawn up and the time when he, the applicant, had been taken from Zagreb Prison to the police interview, the national courts had nevertheless based his conviction on his alleged confession.", "248.  The Government argued that the applicant had had a fair trial and that the applicant’s confession before the police had not been the only evidence proving his guilt, since the trial court had heard evidence from a number of injured parties and their statements had been consistent with the applicant’s confession.", "249.  The trial court had also heard evidence from the police officers and the lawyer implicated and had established that the applicant had been questioned by the police on 2 November 2005 in the presence of lawyer E.Č.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "(a)  Questioning of the applicant by the police", "(i)  General principles", "250.  The relevant principles have been set forth in the Grand Chamber judgment in Salduz v. Turkey ([GC], no. 36391/02, 27 November 2008), as follows:", "“50.  The Court reiterates that, even if the primary purpose of Article 6, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, is to ensure a fair trial by a ‘tribunal’ competent to determine ‘any criminal charge’, it does not follow that the Article has no application to pre-trial proceedings. Thus, Article 6 - especially paragraph 3 – may be relevant before a case is sent for trial if and so far as the fairness of the trial is likely to be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions (Imbrioscia, cited above, § 36). As the Court has already held in its previous judgments, the right set out in paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 of the Convention is one element, amongst others, of the concept of a fair trial in criminal proceedings contained in paragraph 1 (Imbrioscia, cited above, § 37, and Brennan, cited above, § 45).", "51.  The Court further reiterates that although not absolute, the right of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be effectively defended by a lawyer, assigned officially if need be, is one of the fundamental features of fair trial (Poitrimol v. France, 23 November 1993, § 34, Series A no. 277-A, and Demebukov v. Bulgaria, no. 68020/01, § 50, 28 February 2008). Nevertheless, Article 6 § 3 (c) does not specify the manner of exercising this right. It thus leaves to the Contracting States the choice of the means of ensuring that it is secured in their judicial systems, the Court’s task being only to ascertain whether the method they have chosen is consistent with the requirements of a fair trial. In this respect, it must be remembered that the Convention is designed to ‘guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective’ and that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused (Imbrioscia, cited above, § 38).", "52.  National laws may attach consequences to the attitude of an accused at the initial stages of police interrogation which are decisive for the prospects of the defence in any subsequent criminal proceedings. In such circumstances, Article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation. However, this right has so far been considered capable of being subject to restrictions for good cause. The question, in each case, has therefore been whether the restriction was justified and, if so, whether, in the light of the entirety of the proceedings, it has not deprived the accused of a fair hearing, for even a justified restriction is capable of doing so in certain circumstances (see John Murray, cited above, § 63; Brennan, cited above, § 45, and Magee, cited above, § 44).", "53.  These principles, outlined in paragraph 52 above, are also in line with the generally recognised international human rights standards (see paragraphs 37-42 above) which are at the core of the concept of a fair trial and whose rationale relates in particular to the protection of the accused against abusive coercion on the part of the authorities. They also contribute to the prevention of miscarriages of justice and the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6, notably equality of arms between the investigating or prosecuting authorities and the accused.", "54.  In this respect, the Court underlines the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the trial (Can v. Austria, no. 9300/81, Commission’s report of 12 July 1984, § 50, Series A no. 96). At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task it is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. This right indeed presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, § 100, ECHR 2006-..., and Kolu v. Turkey, no. 35811/97, § 51, 2 August 2005). Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination (see, mutatis mutandis, Jalloh, cited above, § 101). In this connection, the Court also notes the recommendations of the CPT (paragraphs 39-40 above), in which the committee repeatedly stated that the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice is a fundamental safeguard against illtreatment. Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies.", "55.  Against this background, the Court finds that in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently ‘practical and effective’ (see paragraph 51 above) Article 6 § 1 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction - whatever its justification - must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6 (see, mutatis mutandis, Magee, cited above, § 44). The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction.”", "(ii)  Application of the above principles in the present case", "251.  The Court notes that the record of the applicant’s questioning bears the date 2 November 2005. However, according to the findings of the national courts the questioning took place on 9 November 2005 and the date 2 November 2005 was a clerical error (see above, paragraph 138).", "252.  The Court further notes that in the written record of the applicant’s questioning it is recorded that lawyer E.Č. was called by the police at 12.30 p.m. and that the interview ended on 1.30 p.m. on 2 November 2005, which should presumably read 9 November 2005.", "253.  However, whichever was the case, whether the lawyer E.Č. was allegedly present between 12.30 p.m. and 1.30 p.m. either on 2 or 9 November 2005, the Court finds that he could not have attended the applicant’s questioning by the police for the following reasons.", "254.  According to the letter of 16 February 2009 from the Zagreb Prison Governor, the applicant, who was in Zagreb Prison at the time, was taken out of that prison for questioning in the Fifth Police Station on 9 November 2005 between 9.25 a.m. and 11.25 a.m. (see above, paragraph 134). This was also accepted by the national courts. Thus it follows that lawyer E.Č. was not present during the applicant’s questioning, since he was called by the police at 12.30 p.m., and even assuming that he arrived immediately at the Fifth Police Station, at that time the applicant had already been returned to Zagreb Prison.", "255.  The question now remains whether the applicant waived his right to legal counsel. In this connection the Court reiterates that neither the letter nor the spirit of Article 6 of the Convention prevents a person from waiving of his own free will, either expressly or tacitly, the entitlement to the guarantees of a fair trial (see Kwiatkowska v. Italy (dec.), no. 52868/99, 30 November 2000). However, if it is to be effective for Convention purposes, a waiver of the right to take part in the trial must be established in an unequivocal manner and be attended by minimum safeguards commensurate to its importance (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, § 86, ECHR 2006-...; Kolu, cited above, § 53; and Colozza v. Italy, 12 February 1985, § 28, Series A no. 89).", "256.  In this connection the Court first observes that the applicant in the present case complained from the initial stages of the proceedings about the lack of legal assistance during his initial police questioning. Furthermore, the Government have not claimed that the applicant waived his right to be legally represented during the police questioning. The Court therefore concludes that the applicant did not waive his right to legal assistance during the police interview.", "257.  Against this background the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3(c) of the Convention on account of the applicant’s questioning by the police on 9 November 2005 without the presence of a defence lawyer.", "(b)  Use of the applicant’s alleged confession to the police in his criminal trial", "258.  The applicant further complained that the fact that his conviction was based on his alleged confession given to the police without the presence of defence counsel ran counter to the guarantees of a fair trial under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "259.  The Court reiterates that its duty, according to Article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting States to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, §§ 45-46, Series A no. 140).", "260.  It is therefore not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence - for example, evidence obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law - may be admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the “unlawfulness” in question ... (see Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, § 34, ECHR 2000V, and Lisica v. , no. 20100/06, § 48, 25 February 2010).", "261.  In the light of the above principles, the Court must determine whether the domestic courts’ admission of statements obtained in the absence of a lawyer during the applicant’s questioning by the police impaired his right to a fair hearing.", "262.  The Court notes that during the entire criminal proceedings in question the applicant was unequivocal in his defence submissions that the content of his alleged confession to the police had been fabricated by the police. The Government denied these allegations and invoked the national courts’ findings. The national courts based their conclusion that the applicant was questioned in a lawyer’s presence on the fact that a statement to this effect had been given by State officials who had a duty to act in accordance with the laws well known to them. However, the Court cannot endorse such a conclusion in the light of the fact that the national courts failed to examine the obvious discrepancy between the alleged time of the presence of lawyer E.Č. and the time of the applicant’s actual questioning (see above, paragraphs 255 and 256).", "263.  The applicant had access to a lawyer after being remanded in custody and during the ensuing criminal proceedings; he thus had the opportunity to challenge the prosecution’s arguments. Nevertheless, as noted above, in convicting the applicant the domestic courts admitted in evidence statements which the applicant had subsequently retracted and which had been obtained during police custody in the absence of a lawyer. They based the applicant’s conviction to a significant degree on this evidence. Thus, in the present case, the applicant was undoubtedly affected by the restrictions on his access to a lawyer. Neither the assistance provided subsequently by a lawyer, nor the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings, could remedy the defects which had occurred during the applicant’s custody (see Salduz, cited above, § 58; Amutgan v. Turkey, no. 5138/04, § 18, 3 February 2009; and Dayanan v. , no. 7377/03, § 33, ECHR 2009...).", "264.  In view of the foregoing, even though the applicant had the opportunity to challenge the evidence against him at the trial and subsequently on appeal, the admission of dubious evidence into the case file affected the applicant’s right to a fair trial to a degree incompatible with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention.", "265.  There has accordingly also been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the admission of evidence given by the applicant to the police without the presence of defence counsel and the reliance on that evidence for the applicant’s conviction.", "V.  OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION", "266.  Lastly, the applicant complained under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention that, by ordering his detention, the national courts had shown that they had actually considered him guilty of the offences he had been charged with, and under Article 14 of the Convention that he was discriminated against on the basis of his social status, alleging that the measure of detention had been ordered against him because he had no property.", "267.  In the light of all the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court considers that this part of the application does not disclose any appearance of a violation of the Convention. It follows that it is inadmissible under Article 35 § 3(a) as manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4 of the Convention.", "VI.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "268.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "269.  The applicant claimed 20,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "270.  The Government considered that claim unfounded and in any event excessive.", "271.  The Court considers that the applicant suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of the violations found. The damage cannot be sufficiently compensated for by a finding of a violation. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 9,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on this amount.", "272.  The Court also considers it necessary to point out that a judgment in which it finds a violation of the Convention or its Protocols imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction, but also to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and make all feasible reparation for the consequences of its violation in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach. In the case of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention, applicants should, to the fullest extent possible, be put in the position they would have been in had the requirements of the Convention not been disregarded (see Yanakiev v. Bulgaria, no. 40476/98, § 89, 10 August 2006, and Putter v. Bulgaria, no. 38780/02, § 61, 2 December 2010).", "273.  The Court notes that Article 430 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the possibility of reopening domestic proceedings if the Court has found a violation of the Convention.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "274.  The applicant also claimed EUR 2,000 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.", "275.  The Government considered that claim excessive.", "276.  According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award in full the sum claimed for the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable on this amount.", "C.  Default interest", "277.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Declares the complaint under Articles 5 §§ 1, 3, and 4, and the complaints under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3(c) of the Convention, admissible, and the remainder of the application inadmissible;", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention;", "", "3.  Holds that it is not necessary to examine the complaint under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention;", "", "4.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, both in respect of the Constitutional Court’s decisions declaring the applicant’s constitutional complaints about his detention inadmissible and in respect of the failure of the appeal court and the  to address the applicant’s arguments that the statutory maximum period for his detention had expired and that the conduct of the proceedings by the lower courts was inefficient;", "", "5.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention on account both of the applicant’s questioning by the police on 2 or 9 November 2005 without the presence of a defence lawyer and of the use of his confession thus obtained in his criminal trial;", "", "6.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Croatian kunas at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:", "(i)  EUR 9,000 (nine thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;", "(ii)  EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "7.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 28 June 2011, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tSøren Nielsen\tAnatoly Kovler\n\tRegistrar\tPresident"]}
