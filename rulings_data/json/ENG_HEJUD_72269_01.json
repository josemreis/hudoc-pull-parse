The applicant alleged various violations of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant provides as follows:", "“...In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law...”", "34.  The Court recalls its finding that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was applicable to the proceedings in present case, which involves the right to a good reputation following social rehabilitation (see the decision on admissibility of 15 June 2004).", "A.  Failure to inform the applicant about the date and time of a hearing", "1.  The parties’ submissions", "35.  The Government submitted that the case file contained a copy of the notification about the date of the hearing before the court of cassation sent to the applicant on 27 July 2000. They also maintained that the register of court’s correspondence, which is a part of the case file, contains a reference to the notification sent to the applicant and the relevant page. The Government concluded that the case file contained enough evidence to show that the applicant was duly informed about the date and time of the court’s hearing of 14 August 2000.", "36.  The Government contended that, even assuming that the applicant did not receive a written notification about the date and time of the hearing, he and / or his representative could have obtained this information directly from the local court or the . They mentioned that the applicant resided near the court, frequently visited it on various matters and had a possibility to consult the secretariat of the court and / or the judges about the date of the hearing. Moreover, under paragraph 6.12 of Instruction no. 22/5 (paragraph 32 above), the secretary of the hearing shall draw up a list of cases designated for examination on a particular date, and record these cases in a register not later than one day before the hearing takes place (Article 297 of the Civil Procedure Code, paragraph 31 above). This list shall be displayed in the court. Such lists are only archived for a year, before being destroyed. Accordingly the relevant list could not be presented to the Court.", "37.  The applicant disagreed. In particular, he mentioned that the notification was never sent to him and its original, not a copy, was included into the court’s case file. Furthermore, the notice was never sent to the defendant in the case, there being also no proof of that in the case file. He contended that he only discovered on 21 August 2000, i.e. after his case had already been determined, about the date of the decisive hearing of 14 August 2000.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "38.  The Court notes that, in accordance with Article 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the notification about the date and time of a hearing had to be sent to the parties by registered letter. The acknowledgment of receipt would then be sent back to the court. In accordance with Article 93 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a court could also send a notification without an acknowledgment of receipt in cases where it considered that the absence of a party at the hearing would not be an obstacle for considering the case. However, if the court found that a person was not duly informed about the date and time of a hearing, it had power to adjourn its examination of the case (see paragraphs 30-32 above).", "39.  The Court considers it unlikely that on 27 July 2000 the applicant received the notification about the date and time of the hearing, as it was only on this date that the Zhovtnevy District Court of Dnipropetrovs’k gave leave for his cassation appeal (this ruling becoming final ten days later). Furthermore, the case was heard on 14 August 2000 by the  on the assumption that the notification of 27 July 2000 had been duly communicated to the applicant. However, the Court observes that no copies of the relevant recorded delivery slips have been submitted to it, nor any note or decision dispensing with this postal method. In fact, the Government have not provided any evidence that the notification was ever sent out. Neither have the Government shown that it was received by the applicant on any particular date, allowing him / or his advocate to prepare for the hearing.", "40.  The Court concludes that the notification arrangements in the instant case were not sufficiently ensured and therefore the applicant was deprived of an opportunity to present his arguments in the course of a public hearing before the . In the Court’s view, this hearing was important given the fact that the defendant to the case was the Deputy President of that court.", "41.  The Court considers therefore that there was a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the failure of the domestic authorities to inform the applicant about the date and time of the hearing in the instant case.", "D.  Lack of a public hearing", "42.  The Government submitted that the case was heard in the course of a public hearing, since the public were not excluded from it and the participation of the applicant and / or his representative was not obligatory, pursuant to the legislation in force. The applicant was properly informed about the time and place of the hearing and his absence cannot be attributable to the State.", "43.  The applicant did not agree. He maintained that his presence at the hearing was important for the fair and objective consideration of his case.", "44.  The Court notes that the applicant’s complaint concerns his own attendance at the hearing rather the wider question of the attendance of the general public. However, this complaint has been largely canvassed in the preceding considerations. Given its conclusion at paragraph 41 above that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the Court finds that it is not necessary to make a separate examination of this aspect of the case.", "II.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "45.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "46.  The applicant claimed USD 10,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.", "47.  The Government maintained that this amount was exorbitant and not justified by any circumstances of the case.", "48.  The Court, making its assessment on equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, awards the applicant EUR 2,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "49.  The applicant submitted a claim relating mainly to the costs of the correspondence with the Court.", "50.  Regard being had to the information in its possession, the Court awards the applicant EUR 200 for costs and expenses.", "C.  Default interest", "51.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;", "", "2.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following sums, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable on the date of payment:", "(i)  EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and", "(ii)  EUR 200 (two hundred euros) for costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "3.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 8 November 2005, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tS.
