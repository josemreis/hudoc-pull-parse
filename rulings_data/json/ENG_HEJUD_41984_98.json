Those proceedings concerned, firstly, the establishment of the fact that the applicant had worked in the “alienation zone” and, secondly, the refusal of the Odessa Regional Administration to grant her  relief worker status on the basis of that fact. Both sets of proceedings were interdependent since they concerned the applicant's right to receive social privileges and a pension as a “ relief worker”. Furthermore, in the course of both sets of proceedings the courts reviewed the same facts on the basis of the same documentary and oral evidence since they concerned the determination of the same civil right. The Court considers therefore that it would be inappropriate to separate these proceedings and to assess their length in isolation.", "75.  The Court observes that the proceedings in issue began in February 1994 and ended on 12 May 2003, when the judgment was enforced and the enforcement proceedings terminated. The overall duration of the proceedings was therefore nine years, one month and five days.

Nevertheless, it may take note of the stage reached in the proceedings prior to 11 September 1997 when examining the complaint as a whole (see, Leshchenko and Tolyupa v.

Germany, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, pp. 1172–73, § 48).", "a.  Complexity of the case", "78.  The Government were of the view that the case was complex as the courts lacked relevant documentary evidence in order to establish the fact of the applicant's stay in the  alienation zone.", "79.  The applicant disagreed.", "80.  Even accepting that the case was to some extent complex as a result of the factual and evidentiary issues which had to be resolved, the Court considers that the overall length of the proceedings cannot be explained by the complexity of the case alone.", "b.  Conduct of the applicant", "81.  The Government were of the view that the parties, not the courts, were responsible for any periods of delay that may have occurred.", "82.  As to the conduct of the applicant, the Court sees no periods of substantial delay for which she was responsible. Moreover, the Government have failed to submit any evidence thereof.", "c.  Conduct of the national authorities", "83.  The Government submitted that the domestic authorities were not responsible for any delays.", "84.  The Court does not agree with the Government's submission. In particular, it considers that there were several periods of delay that must be attributed to the judicial authorities. These include:", "- the remittal of the case for re-consideration on the merits on 6 September 2000 by the Presidium of the Odessa Regional Court, six years after the case had finally been decided;", "- the remittal of the case by the Odessa Regional Court of Appeal for fresh consideration on 14 May 2002, although that court itself had jurisdiction to consider the case on the merits and to deliver a judgment;", "- several remittals of the case from one court to another in order to decide on the admissibility of the appeal lodged by the Odessa Regional Administration (between 14 August 2001 and 22 February 2002).", "d.  The Court's assessment", "85.  The Court considers that throughout the proceedings the applicant behaved diligently. It is also to be noted that the compensation proceedings resulted from and were based on the reduction of the applicant's pension and privileges awarded to her as a  relief worker. Therefore, in view of the applicant's financial situation and her state of health the proceedings were of undeniable importance for her. Accordingly, what was at stake for the applicant called for an expeditious decision on her claims.", "86.  In sum, having regard to the circumstances of the instant case, the length of the proceedings after 11 September 1997 (five years, eight months and one day) and the state of the proceedings on that date, the Court concludes that there was an unreasonable delay in disposing of the applicant's case.", "87.  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 § 1 in that the applicant's “civil right” was not determined within a “reasonable time”.", "B.  Fairness of the proceedings", "1.  In relation to the quashing of the final and binding judgment of 3 March 1994 by the Presidium of the Odessa Regional Court on 6 September 2000 on the basis of a “protest”", "a.  Submissions of the parties", "88.  The applicant further complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention about the unfairness of the decision of 6 September 2000 and the lack of impartiality of the Presidium of the Odessa Regional Court in quashing the decision of the Illichevsk District Court of Odessa of 3 March 1994. In particular, she noted that the hearing before the Presidium of the  had taken place in her absence. She alleged that she had only found out about the hearing after it had already taken place and the decision of the Presidium of the  adopted.", "89.  The Government stressed that although the instant case concerned the quashing of a final judgment, it was nevertheless distinguishable from the case of Brumărescu v. Romania ([GC], no. 28342/95, ECHR 1999-VII), as the protest was lodged by the Deputy President of the  and not by the prosecutor. The supervisory review procedure (процедура розгляду справ в порядку нагляду) was expressly regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure. It contained guarantees to ensure a fair hearing, it was used by Ukrainian citizens to defend their rights and was aimed at correcting judicial errors. The supervisory review did not contradict the principles of the rule of law and legal certainty. The procedure was transparent, foreseeable and was an effective legal mechanism enabling citizens to appeal against erroneous judicial decisions.", "90.  The Government pointed out that the Presidium's decision did not influence the applicant's status, as the case was remitted for fresh consideration and the courts eventually ruled in her favour. ", "b.  The Court's assessment", "91.  The Court considers that this case is similar to the case of Ryabykh v. Russia (no. 52854/99, judgment of 24 July 2003), where it was decided that, in so far as relevant to the instant case:", "“51.  ... the Court reiterates that the right to a fair hearing before a tribunal as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention must be interpreted in the light of the Preamble to the Convention, which declares, in its relevant part, the rule of law to be part of the common heritage of the Contracting States. One of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law is the principle of legal certainty, which requires, among other things, that where the courts have finally determined an issue, their ruling should not be called into question...", "52.  Legal certainty presupposes respect of the principle of res judicata..., that is the principle of finality of judgments. This principle insists that no party is entitled to seek a review of a final and binding judgment merely for the purpose of a rehearing and a fresh decision of the case. Higher courts' power of review should be exercised for correction of judicial mistakes, miscarriages of justice, and not to substitute a review. The review cannot be treated as an appeal in disguise, and the mere possibility of two views on the subject is not a ground for re-examination. Departures from that principle are justified only when made necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character.", "53.  In the applicant's case, however, the judgment ... was overturned ... by the Presidium of the  ... the Novooskolskiy District Court had misinterpreted relevant laws. The Presidium dismissed the applicant's claims and closed the matter, thus setting at naught an entire judicial process which had ended in a decision that was legally binding ... and in respect of which execution proceedings had commenced.", "54.  The Court notes that the supervisory review of the judgment ... was set in motion by the President of the Belgorod Regional Court – who was not party to the proceedings ... As with the situation under Romanian law examined in Brumărescu, the exercise of this power by the President was not subject to any time-limit, so that judgments were liable to challenge indefinitely.", "55.  The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way it embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect. However, that right would be illusory if a 's domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. It would be inconceivable that Article 6 § 1 should describe in detail procedural guarantees afforded to litigants – proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious – without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions; to construe Article 6 as being concerned exclusively with access to a court and the conduct of proceedings would be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention (see Hornsby v. Greece, judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports 1997-II, p. 510, § 40).", "56.  The Court considers that the right of a litigant to a court would be equally illusory if a 's legal system allowed a judicial decision which had become final and binding to be quashed by a higher court on an application made by a State official.", "57.  By using the supervisory-review procedure to set aside the judgment of 8 June 1998 the Presidium of the Belgorod Regional Court infringed the principle of legal certainty and the applicant's “right to a court” under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention...”", "92.  The Court notes that in the instant case the Deputy President of the  lodged a protest (протест в порядку нагляду) on 28 August 2000 against the decision of the Illichevsk District Court of Odessa of 3 March 1994 that had become final and binding. By a decision of the Presidium of the  on 6 September 2000, this decision was quashed and the case was remitted for re-consideration. Furthermore, the Court has already found a violation in this respect in its judgment in Sovtransavto Holding v.  (Sovtransavto Holding v. , no. 48553/99, § 77, ECHR 2002VII):", "“The Court considers that judicial systems characterised by the objection (protest) procedure and, therefore, by the risk of final judgments being set aside repeatedly, as occurred in the instant case, are, as such, incompatible with the principle of legal certainty that is one of the fundamental aspects of the rule of law for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, read in the light of Brumărescu ...”", "It does not see any reason for departing from the aforementioned judgments. It considers, therefore, that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 in respect of the quashing of the final and binding judgment given in the applicant's case.", "2.  Lack of independence and impartiality", "a.  Submissions of the parties", "93.  The Government maintained that, although the Deputy President of the  had heard his own protest, the Presidium had been chaired by the President of the  and other judges of that court heard the case sitting in a chamber. They maintained that the principles of independence and impartiality had not been infringed by the Presidium of the  and there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "94.  The applicant did not comment on this point.", "b.  The Court's assessment", "95.  The Court reiterates that in order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered “independent” for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of safeguards against outside pressures and the question whether it presents an appearance of independence (see, among many other authorities, Findlay v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, p. 281, § 73). As to the issue of impartiality, its existence, for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, must be determined according to a subjective test, that is on the basis of the personal conviction and behaviour of a particular judge in a given case, and also according to an objective test, that is, ascertaining whether the judge offered sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see, among many other authorities, Bulut v. Austria, judgment of 22 February 1996, Reports 1996- I, p. 356, § 31, and Thomann v. Switzerland, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 815, § 30).", "96.  In this case it appears that an issue arises concerning the subjective impartiality of the Deputy President of the . It will consider this issue only.", "97.  The Court notes that the protest of the Deputy President of the  was lodged with the Presidium of that same court. The Deputy President of the  examined the protest that he lodged with the Presidium, of which he was a member and Deputy President, along with his colleagues sitting in the Presidium. The Court is of the opinion that this practice is incompatible with the “subjective impartiality” of a judge hearing a particular case, since no one can be both plaintiff and judge in his own case.", "98.  It considers therefore that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the lack of impartiality of the Deputy President of the .", "c.  Remainder of the complaints with regard to the protest", "99.  The Court does not propose to look into the other defects of the supervisory review proceedings raised by the applicant, such as the lack of a public hearing in her case before the Presidium and the lack of timely information given to her about the protest lodged. It notes in this connection that the protest procedure, as described in Brumărescu (cited above, § 62), “set at naught an entire judicial process which had ended in (...) a judicial decision that was (...) res judicata”. ", "100.  It considers therefore that no separate issue arises in the instant case with regard to the other defects of the supervisory review proceedings.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1 TO THE CONVENTION", "101.  The applicant further complained about the infringement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention as a result of the lack of fairness of the proceedings in her case and the unreasonable length of time taken to enforce the judgment  given in her favour. This provision reads as follows:", "“Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.", "The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.”", "A.  Submissions of the parties", "102.  The Government pointed out that there had been no violation of the applicant's rights. In their view, the instant case raised issues similar to the case of Skórkiewicz v. Poland (no. 39860/98 (dec.), 1 June 1999). In particular, the Government contended that, even though at one point the applicant lost her status as a  relief worker, she nevertheless retained the right to receive the pension granted to persons within another disability group (друга група інвалідності). They recalled that, in accordance with the judgment of the Primorsky District Court of Odessa, the applicant's status as a relief worker had been restored and she had been granted a pension for her Chernobyl-related disability. As regards the refusal of the Department of the Odessa Municipal Council to increase her pension on account of her relief work, the Government pointed out that the applicant had no documents to confirm the number of hours she had spent in the alienation zone. Furthermore, the applicant had not appealed against this refusal.", "103.  The applicant disagreed. She maintained that she had suffered pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage due to the loss of her status as a  relief worker. In particular, she alleged that she should receive a substantially higher amount of pension and various State privileges, such as the provision of an apartment.", "B.  The Court's assessment", "104.  The Court concludes that the applicant was deprived of her pension right and State privileges established by law for the benefit of  relief workers, which were more substantial in value than ordinary disability pensions and State privileges. Her right to such was recognised by a final and binding judgment. The applicant therefore had an enforceable claim within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which constituted a “possession” within the meaning of that provision (see Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301B, § 59 etc). Taking into account the applicant's financial and social status and the fact that the situation was partially rectified by the judgment of the Malinovsky District Court of Odessa of 24 May 2004, the Court notes that the impossibility for the applicant to obtain enforcement of the judgment recognising her status of a “Chernobyl relief worker” for an unreasonably long period of time constituted an interference with her right to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions. The Government have not advanced any justification for that interference.", "105.  The Court finds therefore that there has been an infringement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.", "III.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "106.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "107.  The applicant initially claimed 30,000  dollars (USD) in just satisfaction. In her subsequent claims, including those submitted to the Court on 3 August 2004, she alleged that she should be paid USD 200,000 in compensation. In particular she claimed \nUSD 50,000-60,000 in compensation for the cost of the apartment that was not provided to her by the State and USD 2,700 for loss of her pension. The applicant further claimed compensation for non-pecuniary damage. She also claimed that the Government ought to provide her with an apartment in accordance with her status.", "108.  As to the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage claimed by the applicant, the Government maintained that it was excessive. The Government further maintained that the amount of compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage claimed by the applicant was unsubstantiated as it was not supported by any relevant evidence. ", "109.  The Court makes no award in relation to the pecuniary damage claimed by the applicant since there is no substantiation that that damage flowed from the Convention breaches found. The Court also notes in this respect that the applicant was awarded compensation for the loss of her pension by the judgment of 24 May 2004 of the Malinovsky District Court. Nevertheless, it finds that the applicant may be considered to have suffered some degree of frustration and distress, given the lengthy period of uncertainty which she has endured as a result of the quashing of the final and binding judgment in her favour and the length of the enforcement proceedings. It therefore awards her on an equitable basis 20,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "110.  The applicant claimed costs and expenses for the Convention proceedings and for the proceedings before the domestic courts. In particular, she referred to the cost of telephone calls, postal expenses and translation of correspondence for the period of proceedings in her case.", "111.  The Government proposed that no award should be made.", "112.  The Court concludes that it is quite clear that the applicant incurred some legal fees in relation to the proceedings before the Court. However, she had not specified these expenditures and has not provided any relevant proof thereof. Regard being had to the information in the case-file and the criteria established in the Court's case-law (see Shmalko v. Ukraine, no. 60750/00, judgment of 20 July 2004, §§ 63-64; Merit v. Ukraine, no. 66561/01, judgment of 30 March 2004, § 88), the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant EUR 500 for costs and expenses.", "C.  Default interest", "113.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the length of the proceedings in the applicant's case; ", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the quashing of a final and binding judgment given in the applicant's favour;", "", "3.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the lack of impartiality of the Deputy President of the  in the supervisory review proceedings;", "", "4.  Holds that it is not necessary to examine the other defects of the supervisory review proceedings raised by the applicant;", "", "5.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention;", "", "6.  Holds:", "", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into the national currency of Ukraine at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:", "(i)  EUR 20,000 (twenty thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage;", "(ii)  EUR 500 (five hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses;", "(iii)  any tax that may be chargeable.", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.", "", "7.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 9 November 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "", "\tT.L.
