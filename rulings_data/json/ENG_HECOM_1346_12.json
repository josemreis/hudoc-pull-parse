He is represented before the Court by Mr A. Lillo, a lawyer practising in .", "A.  The circumstances of the case", "The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.", "The applicant is an entrepreneur, a member of the Narva City Council and chairman of its financial committee.", "On 27 October 2010 criminal investigation into influence peddling in municipalities of the  was initiated.", "On 12 July 2011 the applicant was arrested under suspicion of prejudicing free competition, influence peddling, demanding bribes and money laundering.", "On 13 July 2011 he was presented with a formal suspicion. It appears that in the suspicion reference was made to certain unlawful practices in general as well as some specific acts allegedly committed by the applicant.", "Also on 13 July 2011 the prosecutor asked the Viru County Court to issue a detention order for the applicant. He considered that the evidence presented to the court (statements of witnesses and suspects, copies of contracts, procurement documents, bank account statements, inspection reports and surveillance reports) gave grounds for the suspicion against the applicant. Furthermore, bringing of further charges against the applicant could not be excluded since there were hints about other similar episodes. The prosecutor noted that considering the nature of the crimes the applicant was suspected of and having regard to his active and leading role therein, there was a reasoned suspicion that, if at liberty, he could compromise the ongoing investigation by tampering with the evidence or exerting pressure on witnesses or other suspects. In the course of the investigation several witnesses (including municipal officials) had testified that the applicant had influenced them to take decisions in his favour and threatened them with troubles or loss of employment. There was further information and evidence indicating that the applicant was a wealthy and influential person who could carry out his threats and affect the processes in the city. Reference was also made to a number of his acts referring to his ongoing corrupt behaviour regardless of the detention of a number of his accomplices. The prosecutor considered that there was a real risk that, if at liberty, the applicant could contact other persons in order to hinder the investigation and influence the municipal officials, entrepreneurs and other witnesses who had so far given statements against him. Exerting influence on the witnesses or tampering with the evidence could be seen as possible offences.", "Before the hearing on 13 July 2011 the prosecutor gave the County Court judge a possibility to examine the case file. Then the court heard the prosecutor and the applicant who was assisted by a lawyer. The lawyer requested access to the material presented to the court; the prosecutor objected.

Referring to the material in the case file it considered that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable suspicion against the applicant. The court endorsed the prosecutor’s arguments as to the need for the applicant’s detention. It considered that this was necessary in order to prevent the commission of further crimes by him.", "On 17 August 2011 the Tartu Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the detention order.", "Although no appeal lay against the appeal court’s decision, the applicant filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, relying on the unconstitutionality of the lower court’s interpretation of the law. By a letter of 21 September 2011 the Supreme Court returned the appeal because no appeal lay against the appeal court’s decision.", "On 13 September 2011 the applicant’s lawyer requested the Viru County Court to verify the reasons for the applicant’s detention and to release him.", "On 23 September 2011 the  dismissed the request. It reiterated its position that considering the circumstances of the offences allegedly committed by the applicant as well as his active and leading role therein, there was a well-founded risk that the applicant, if at liberty, could tamper with evidence and exert pressure on witnesses and suspects. He was considered to have wide and close political and economic connections and corresponding influence. Thus, the court considered that there were sound reasons for the applicant’s continued detention. No appeal lay against that decision.", "In the meantime, the applicant requested release on bail. On 5 September 2011 the  dismissed the request finding that, if released, the applicant could continue to commit offences. It referred in this context to the applicant’s past behaviour – he was suspected of commission of a number of different offences committed in the course of several years and further charges could be brought against him. In the course of the preliminary investigation witnesses had made statements about how the applicant had exerted influence on them. The information and evidence gathered indicated that the applicant could carry out his threats. There was information that he had continued his corrupt activities despite the detention of several accomplices.", "On 4 October 2011 the Tartu Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the County Court’s decision of 5 September 2011. It concurred with the lower court’s opinion and added that the applicant’s release on bail would not exclude him obstructing the establishment of the truth in the criminal case, regard being had to the nature of the suspicion, the number of persons related to it and the fact that the preliminary investigation was still in its initial stage. An appeal lay to the Supreme Court but there is no information on whether the applicant availed himself of this remedy.", "On 15 November 2011 the applicant’s lawyer requested the Viru County Court to verify the reasons for the applicant’s detention and to release him.", "On 12 December 2011 the  dismissed the request. It found that the circumstances that had served as grounds for placing the applicant in detention had not ceased to exist. It again referred to the applicant’s role in the commission of the presumed offences and considered that, if at liberty, he could tamper with evidence and influence accused and witnesses. No appeal lay against the decision.", "B.  Relevant domestic law and practice", "It follows from Articles 33 to 35 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kriminaalmenetluse seadustik) that an accused, unlike a suspect, has the right to examine the criminal file through his or her counsel.

The Supreme Court declined to rule on the merits of the case in the constitutional review proceedings noting that other proceedings were available for the person concerned for the judicial protection of his rights.
