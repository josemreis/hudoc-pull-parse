Following the principal judgment, the authorities took steps to comply with the relevant court judgment in respect of the agricultural land, which had been the source of the violation found. They adopted a decision for the return of the agricultural land to the applicants and instructed them as to the formalities to be complied with in order to complete the restitution process. As regards the other plots of land, the restitution process still appeared to be ongoing.", "Law – Article 41: Provided the applicants’ cooperated with the authorities, it was reasonable to expect the restitution process to be completed within three months from the date the Court’s judgment became final. Failing the actual transfer of the land to the applicants within that time, the respondent State was to pay jointly to all the applicants the current value of the plots at issue (EUR 433,000 for the agricultural land and EUR 120,000 for the other plots) in respect of pecuniary damage. As regards non-pecuniary damage, the Court awarded each of the applicants EUR 1,000.", "Article 46: Having received a number of other applications against Bulgaria raising a similar issue to the one in the applicants’ case, the Court noted that there might be a systemic problem in Bulgaria in this respect. It therefore ordered that certain general measures be adopted in the execution of its judgment in this case, namely that clear time-limits be set concerning the enforcement of final judgments relating to the restitution of agricultural land and that a remedy be introduced affording the persons concerned an effective means of obtaining compensation should such time-limits not be observed.", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the ", ""]}
