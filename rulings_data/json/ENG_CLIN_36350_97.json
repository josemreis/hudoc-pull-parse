His brother, whom the court had informed of that application, requested on 27 April 1993 that the distribution be extended to his father’s estate. In an order of 8 July 1993 the presiding judge of the tribunal d’instance granted the applications and appointed two notaries to distribute the estates. He instructed the parties to address their claims to them. Thereafter the proceedings were conducted exclusively before those two officers. The court’s only involvement was to forward to the notaries, instructing them to reply, a request from the applicant who, not having received any information about the proceedings, was enquiring as to their progress. On 4 December 1997 the court discontinued the proceedings as the parties had decided to withdraw their application for distribution by the courts.", "Admissible under Article 6 § 1.", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the "]}
