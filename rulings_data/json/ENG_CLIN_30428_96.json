The employer appealed against the costs order. The applicant was not notified of the appeal, which was granted by the Court of Appeal.", "Law: Article 6 § 1 – The Court saw no reason to disagree with the Commission's conclusion that this provision applies to costs proceedings if the costs at issue were incurred in the determination of civil rights and obligations, as in this case.
