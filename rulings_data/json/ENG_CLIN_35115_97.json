Following serious threats he made against members of the prison staff, criminal proceedings were initiated against him. The Regional Court held a hearing in the “closed area” of the prison, although according to the minutes the hearing was public.

He argued, inter alia, that the hearing had not been public since it had taken place in the “closed area” of the prison where only people with a special permit were allowed and that it had been held in a room too small for anyone to attend it.
