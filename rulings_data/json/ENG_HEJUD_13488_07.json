Rožman, Mrs M. Oredić, Mr D. Bartolac and Mr H. Rožman, all from the Law Firm Rožman & Oredić, advocates practising in Karlovac. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.", "3.  The applicant alleged, in particular, that by refusing his claim for the purchase of the flat at issue the domestic authorities had violated his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.", "4.  On 25 November 2008 the President of the First Section decided to communicate the complaint concerning the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions to the Government.", "THE FACTS", "I.  THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE", "5.  The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Vojnić.", "6.  In 1980 the applicant became the holder of a specially protected tenancy (stanarsko pravo) of a flat in Vojnić. He lived in the flat with his family until 1 October 1991 when Vojnić was occupied. He then fled the occupying forces and went to live in Karlovac.", "7.  The applicant found a job in Karlovac and, as an internally displaced person, on 30 January 1992 he was awarded a flat there on a temporary basis. In July 1996 the competent authorities terminated his status as an internally displaced person. Following a civil action by Mr T.M., the applicant was forced to leave the flat in Karlovac on 21 January 1999.", "8.  The applicant claimed that – following the military operation “Storm” by which Croatia regained control of almost its entire territory in August 1995 – on 8 October 1995 he had visited Vojnić, where he had found the flat in respect of which he had the specially protected tenancy uninhabitable and in a very bad state of repair. This had been confirmed on 4 March 1996 by the findings of the Commission for the Assessment of War Damage. He further submitted that he had immediately commenced rebuilding work on the flat with a view to moving into it.", "9.  However, on 23 August 1996, while the applicant was working in Karlovac, the local authorities, accompanied by the police, entered into the flat, made a list of personal belongings, changed the locks and gave the keys of the flat to a certain Z.H., a local policeman. Five days later the Commission for Temporary Takeover and Use of Certain Property of the  (Komisija za privremeno preuzimanje i korištenje određene imovine Općine Vojnić – “the Sequestration Commission”) issued a decision letting the flat to Z.H. and his family on a temporary basis.", "10.  On 20 December 1996 the applicant and his wife made a request for the purchase of the flat to the . In doing so they relied on the Specially Protected Tenancies ( to Occupier) Act, which entitled holders of specially protected tenancies of flats in social or state ownership to purchase their flats under favourable conditions (see paragraph 29 below). They received no reply.", "11.  On 7 August 1998 the Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (Ministarstvo razvitka i obnove) adopted a decision letting the flat to Z.H. and his family for their use.", "12.  On 16 October 2000 the  issued a decision allowing the applicant to live in the flat. The applicant has been living in the flat ever since.", "13.  Meanwhile, on 12 May 2000, the applicant and his wife brought a civil action against the State in the Vojnić Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Vojniću) with a view to obtaining a judgment which would allow them to purchase the flat in accordance with the Specially Protected Tenancies ( to Occupier) Act. On 9 January 2001 the court dismissed their action. It found that the applicant's flat was owned by the State and not the  and that therefore the plaintiffs should have directed their request for its purchase to the State and not to the Municipality. Following an appeal by the applicant and his wife, on 26 September 2001 the  (Županijski sud u Karlovcu) quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case. It found, inter alia, that the fact that the plaintiffs had made their request for the purchase of the flat to the Municipality and not the State should not have been held against them.", "14.  In the resumed proceedings, on 11 September 2003 the Vojnić Municipal Court again dismissed the plaintiffs' action. The court first determined, as a preliminary issue, whether the plaintiffs had retained their specially protected tenancy of the flat in Vojnić, the existence of that tenancy being a statutory precondition for buying the flat under the  to Occupier Act. In this respect the court found that: (a) the plaintiffs had left the flat in October 1991 and (b) in the period between 5 August 1995, when Vojnić was liberated, and 23 August 1996, when the flat was awarded to Z.H., they had been living in Karlovac and had only occasionally visited and used the flat in Vojnić. That being so, the court concluded that since they had not used their flat permanently for living purposes, the plaintiffs' specially protected tenancy had been terminated. Consequently, they were not entitled to purchase the flat in question.", "15.  On 18 February 2004 the  dismissed the plaintiffs' appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment, which thereby acquired the force of res judicata. Relying on the finding of the first-instance court that the plaintiffs had left the flat in 1991 and had not used it in the period between 5 August 1995 and 23 August 1996, the second-instance court expressly referred to section 2 of the Act on the Lease of Flats on the Liberated Territory (see paragraph 19 below) in holding that the plaintiffs' specially protected tenancy had been terminated ex lege because after the Act's entry into force they had not used their flat for a period longer than ninety days. As a result, they had no right to purchase it.", "16.  The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint alleging, inter alia, infringements of his constitutional rights to equality before the law, to property and to a fair hearing.", "17.  On 29 June 2006 the  (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the constitutional complaint and served its decision on the applicant on 20 July 2006. The relevant part of the 's decision reads as follows:", "“The [ordinary] courts established that the flat at issue in Vojnić had on 28 August 1996 been awarded to [Z.H.] for temporary use, and that the plaintiffs had in the period between August 1995 and 28 August 1996 only occasionally visited the flat, which could not be considered use of the flat. The first-instance court therefore dismissed the plaintiff's action in accordance with section 2 of the Act on the Lease of Flats on the Liberated Territory, according to which the specially protected tenancy of flats located in the previously occupied, now liberated, territory of the Republic of Croatia was to be terminated by the operation of law if the holder of the specially protected tenancy left the flat and did not use it for a period exceeding 90 days following the Act's entry into force. The court established that the complainant had not used the flat between August 1995 and 28 August 1996 and that his specially protected tenancy had [therefore] been terminated by the operation of law. Given that his specially protected tenancy had been terminated by the operation of law after 5 January 1996, the complainant could no longer be considered the holder of a specially protected tenancy and therefore was not entitled to make a request for the purchase of the flat.", "The County Court found that the first-instance judgment was correct and had been rendered on the basis of correctly and completely established facts and the correct application of the substantive law.", "Assessing the arguments raised in the constitutional complaint in the light of Article 14 paragraph 2 of the Constitution, the  has found that the complainant's constitutional right to equality before the law was not breached by the contested judgments.", "The legal views expressed in the contested judgments are based on the correct application of the relevant substantive law and on the constitutionally acceptable interpretation of that law.

Since he had left Vojnić in 1991 in order to flee the occupying forces and had returned in October 1995, the legislation in question could not have applied to him and his specially protected tenancy could not have been terminated ex lege.

Where, as in the present case, a proprietary interest is in the nature of a claim, it may be regarded as an “asset” only if there is a sufficient basis for that interest in national law (for example, where there is settled case-law of the domestic courts confirming it), that is, when the claim is sufficiently established to be enforceable (see Kopecký v. Slovakia [GC], no. 44912/98, §§ 48-49 and 52, ECHR 2004IX, and Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece, 9 December 1994, § 59, Series A no. 301B).", "40.  The Court notes that persons wishing to purchase a flat under the Sale to Occupier Act had to satisfy two conditions: (a) they had to submit their request for purchase of the flat within the time-limit fixed in section 4(2) of that Act, and (b) they had to be holders of the specially protected tenancy of the flat they wanted to buy, that is, their tenancy should not have been terminated before the expiry of that time-limit (see paragraphs 29-30 above).", "41.  Turning to the present case, the Court first notes that the domestic courts dismissed the applicant's claim for purchase of the flat because they found that his specially protected tenancy – the existence of which was a statutory precondition for buying the flat under the  to Occupier Act – had been terminated. In particular, the second-instance court, in its judgment of 18 February 2004, expressly referred to section 2 of the Act on the Lease of Flats on the Liberated Territory and held that the applicant's specially protected tenancy had been terminated ex lege because after the Act's entry into force he had not used his flat for a period longer than ninety days (see paragraph 15 above).", "42.  However, the Court further notes that in its decisions nos.

U-III-2174/2002 of 6 May 2005) that the complainants, who were the holders of a specially protected tenancy, had left that territory in 1991, the Constitutional Court held that the Act in question could not be applied to them (see paragraphs 20 and 22 above).", "43.  Having regard to the fact that the domestic courts established that the applicant had left Vojnić on 1 October 1991 (see paragraphs 14-15 above), the Court is of the view that he was entitled to consider, in the light of the case-law of the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 20-22 above), that he retained his specially protected tenancy because the Act on the Lease of Flats on the Liberated Territory, according to the interpretation provided by that court, did not apply to him.", "44.  Furthermore, given that the applicant made the request for the purchase of the flat on 20 December 1996 (see paragraph 10 above), that is, within the statutory time-limit set forth in section 4(2) of the Sale to Occupier Act (see paragraph 30 above), it follows that all the conditions for acquiring the right to purchase the flat were met in the applicant's case.", "45.  The Court therefore considers that, in contrast to the Gaćeša case relied on by the Government (see Gaćeša, cited above), on the day of the Convention's entry into force in respect of Croatia on 5 November 1997, the applicant's claim to purchase the flat in the present case had a sufficient basis in national law to qualify as an “asset” and therefore a “possession” protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.", "46.  It follows that the Government's objections as to incompatibility ratione temporis and ratione materiae must be dismissed.", "2.  Non-exhaustion of domestic remedies", "(a)  The arguments of the parties", "47.  The Government noted that the applicant had argued that he was unable to use the flat in question, inter alia, because Z.H. had broken into it. However, they pointed out that the applicant had not availed himself of any remedies in order to challenge Z.H.'s right to use the flat in question and/or to seek his eviction.", "48.  The applicant replied that he had not been a party to the administrative proceedings leading to the decision of 28 August 1996 (see paragraph 9 above) whereby the Sequestration Commission had let the flat to Z.H. and his family on a temporary basis. That decision had never been served on him and therefore he had not been able to use any remedies against it.", "(b)  The Court's assessment", "49.  The Court reiterates that the domestic courts found that the applicant's specially protected tenancy had been terminated ex lege by the application of section 2(1) of the Act on the Lease of Flats on the Liberated Territory because had not used the flat at issue in the period between 5 August 1995 and 23 August 1996 (see paragraph 15 above), that is, in the period before the local authorities had entered into his flat on the last-mentioned date and allocated it to Z.H. on 28 August 1996 (see paragraph 9 above). The Court therefore does not see how resorting to available domestic remedies with a view to contesting Z.H.'s right to use the flat and/or seeking his eviction could have prevented or remedied the termination of the applicant's specially protected tenancy.", "50.  It follows that the Government's objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must also be dismissed.", "51.  The Court further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  Whether there was an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of “possessions”", "52.  Relying on their above argument that the applicant's specially protected tenancy had been terminated ex lege before the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Croatia, (see paragraph 36), the Government submitted that the subsequent domestic court judgments refusing his claim to purchase the flat could not have amounted to an interference with his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions because at the time they were rendered he did not have a sufficient proprietary interest to constitute a “possession” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.", "53.  The applicant did not make any specific comments on this issue. However, it follows from his submissions that he considered that there had been an interference with his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.", "54.  In the light of its above finding that the applicant's claim for the purchase of the flat was sufficiently established to qualify as an “asset” attracting the protection of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraphs 39-46 above), the Court considers that the refusal of the domestic courts to grant that claim undoubtedly constituted an interference with his right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. This interference occurred on 18 February 2004 when the  upheld the first-instance judgment of the Vojnić Municipal Court of 11 September 2003, which thereby acquired the force of res judicata.", "55.  The Court must further examine whether that interference was justified, that is, whether it was provided for by law, whether it was in the public or general interest and whether it was proportional.", "2.  Whether the interference was “provided for by law”", "(a)  The arguments of the parties", "(i)  The Government", "56.  The Government submitted that it was undisputed that the domestic courts' decisions were based on law, in particular the Act on the Lease of Flats on the .", "57.  They further argued that in its decision of 29 June 2006, delivered following the applicant's constitutional complaint, the  had not departed from the previous case-law established by its decision U-III-1701/2000 of 3 June 2003 (see paragraph 20 above). In the last-mentioned decision the Constitutional Court had also held that the Act on the Lease of Flats on the Liberated Territory, including section 2 of that Act, which had provided for the ex lege termination of specially protected tenancies, applied to all persons who had left the previously occupied territory of Croatia after its liberation in 1995, that is, to those holders of a specially protected tenancy who had not used their flats for a period exceeding ninety days following the Act's entry into force. In the present case, the  had found that the applicant had not used the flat in Vojnić in the period between August 1995 and August 1996, that is, after the liberation of the previously occupied territory. Therefore, the Act on the Lease of Flats on the  was applicable to him. The  had taken the same view in its decision no. U-III-1451/2004, by which it had dismissed a constitutional complaint in a case that was factually and legally identical to that of the applicant (see paragraph 21 above).", " (ii)  The applicant", "58.  The applicant reiterated his arguments (see paragraph 38 above) that the Act on the Lease of Flats on the  could not be applied to him.", "(b) The Court's assessment", "59.  The Court reiterates that the first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful (see Iatridis v. Greece [GC], no. 31107/96, § 58, ECHR 1999II). In this connection, the Court agrees with the Government that the decisions of the domestic courts in the present case had a legal basis in domestic law as their refusal to grant the applicant's claim for purchase of the flat was based on section 2 of the Act on the Lease of Flats on the .", "60.  However, the Court further reiterates that the existence of a legal basis is not in itself sufficient to satisfy the principle of lawfulness. When speaking of “law”, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 alludes to a concept which comprises statutory law as well as case-law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, for example, Mullai and Others v. Albania, no. 9074/07, § 113, 23 March 2010; Špaček, s.r.o. v. the Czech Republic, no. 26449/95, § 54, 9 November 1999; and Carbonara and Ventura v. Italy, no. 24638/94, § 64, ECHR 2000VI).", "61.  In this connection, the Court first notes that the application by the ordinary courts of the Act on the Lease of Flats on the Liberated Territory to the applicant's case was not in line with the interpretation and practice of the Constitutional Court, according to which that Act could not be applied to situations similar to that of the applicant (see paragraphs 20 and 22 above).", "62.  The Court further notes that, following the applicant's constitutional complaint, the  had an opportunity to quash the judgments of the ordinary courts, which were contrary to its previous decisions. However, it did not do so. Instead, it dismissed the applicant's constitutional complaint.", "63.  Therefore, in the applicant's case not only the judgments of the ordinary courts but also the decision of the  itself were contrary to that court's earlier case-law.", "64.  At this juncture the Court finds it appropriate to address the Government's argument that in dismissing the applicant's constitutional complaint the  did not depart from its previous case-law established in decisions nos. U-III-1701/2000 of 3 June 2003, U-III-1451/2004 of 9 December 2004 and U-III-2174/2002 of 6 May 2005. The Court notes that in those decisions the  clearly stated that the Act on the Lease of Flats on the Liberated Territory applied only to those holders of a specially protected tenancy who had left the previously occupied  after August 1995. Therefore, in two of those cases the  held that the legislation in question could not be applied to the complainants, as they had left their flats before 1995. It thus allowed their constitutional complaints (see paragraphs 20 and 22 above). In the remaining case it dismissed the constitutional complaint because it found that the complainant in that case, unlike the applicant in the present case, had left her flat in August 1995 (see paragraph 21 above). Having regard to the fact that in the applicant's case the ordinary courts established that the applicant had left Vojnić on 1 October 1991 (see paragraphs 14-15 above), which finding was not contested by the Constitutional Court, the Court does not find that his case was different from those mentioned above. Accordingly, the Court cannot accept the Government's argument that the 's decision in the applicant's case was consistent with that court's previous case-law.", "65.  The Court further notes that in its decision dismissing the applicant's constitutional complaint the  did not attempt to distinguish the applicant's case from its previous decisions, nor did it indicate its intention to depart from its interpretation of the Act on the Lease of Flats on the . What is more, the Government did not furnish any relevant decisions that would indicate a change in the 's practice or otherwise enable the Court to ascertain why the applicant's case was decided differently. Therefore, it cannot be discerned whether in the applicant's case the Constitutional Court simply neglected its previous jurisprudence or whether it consciously departed from it and, if so, why.", "66.  The Court has already held, in the context of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, that the Contracting States have an obligation to organise their legal system so as to avoid the adoption of discordant judgments (see Vrioni and Others v. Albania, no. 2141/03, § 58, 24 March 2009, and Mullai and Others, cited above, § 86), and that conflicting decisions in similar cases stemming from the same court which, in addition, is the court of last resort in the matter, may, in the absence of a mechanism which ensures consistency, breach the principle of legal certainty inherent in that Article (see, for example, Beian v.  (no. 1), no. 30658/05, §§ 36-39, ECHR 2007XIII; Tudor Tudor v. Romania, no. 21911/03, § 29, 24 March 2009; and Iordan Iordanov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 23530/02, §§ 47-53, 2 July 2009).", "67.  The Court has also held that where such manifestly conflicting decisions interfere with the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions and no reasonable explanation is given for the divergence, such interferences cannot be considered lawful for the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention because they lead to an inconsistent case-law which lacks the required precision to enable individuals to foresee the consequences of their actions (see Carbonara and Ventura, cited above, § 65; Mullai and Others, cited above, §§ 115-117; and Saghinadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 18768/05, §§ 116-118, 27 May 2010).", "68.  Having regard to the foregoing considerations, it follows that the impugned interference in the form of the Vojnić Municipal Court's judgment of 11 September 2003 was not foreseeable for the applicant who, relying on the existing case-law of the , could reasonably have expected that his claim for the purchase of the flat would be granted. The interference was therefore incompatible with the principle of lawfulness and hence contravened Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. This finding makes it unnecessary to examine whether a fair balance has been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the applicant's fundamental rights.", "There has, accordingly, been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION", "69.  The applicant further complained under Article 8 of the Convention that by breaking into his flat and letting it to Z.H. the domestic authorities had violated his right to respect for his home. Article 8 of the Convention reads as follows:", "“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for ... his home and his correspondence.", "2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”", "70.  In so far as the applicant may be understood to complain about the actual entering into his flat on 23 August 1996 and the decision of the Sequestration Commission of 28 August 1996 (see paragraph 9 above) whereby it let the flat to Z.H., the Court notes that these events took place before the Convention entered into force in respect of Croatia on 5 November 1997.", "71. To the extent that the applicant complains of the decision of the Ministry of Reconstruction and Development of 7 August 1998 (see paragraph 11 above), the Court notes that the applicant could have challenged it before the , but he did not do so.", "72.  It follows that this complaint is, in its respective aspects, inadmissible as incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention and for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 35 § 1 thereof and must therefore be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4.", "III.  ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 6 § 1 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION", "73.  Lastly, the applicant complained under Articles 6 § 1 and 13 of the Convention that he had not had access to a court nor an effective remedy in order to challenge the forcible entry into his flat or the domestic authorities' decisions of 28 August 1996 and 7 August 1998 to let his flat to Z.H. Articles 6 and 13 read as follows:", "Article 6 § 1", "“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...”", "Article 13", "“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”", "74.  The Court refers to its above findings (see paragraphs 70-72), according to which the applicant's complaint under Article 8 of the Convention is inadmissible as incompatible ratione temporis and for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. It follows that in so far as the applicant's complaints under Article 6 § 1 and 13 concern the alleged lack of access to a court and an effective remedy in respect of the break-in of his flat on 23 August 1996, and the decision of the Sequestration Commission of 28 August 1996, they are also inadmissible as incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention. To the extent that these complaints concern the decision of the Ministry of Reconstruction and Development of 7 August 1998 they are inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. They must therefore be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4 of the Convention.", "IV.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "75.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "76.  In his application form the applicant claimed 50,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 1,200 in respect of costs and expenses. However, he did not submit a just satisfaction claim, nor did he resubmit (even by referring to them) the claims made in the application form within the time-limit fixed for submission of his Article 41 claims, that is, within the time-limit for submission of his observations (Rule 60 § 3 of the Rules of Court). The applicant failed to (re)submit the just satisfaction claims within the time allowed even though he was reminded that he had to do so even if he had indicated his wishes concerning just satisfaction at an earlier stage of the proceedings.", "77.  The Government noted that the applicant had not submitted a claim for just satisfaction in his observations but they nevertheless contested the claims made in the application form.", "78.  The Court reiterates that a judgment in which it finds a breach imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation to put an end to the breach and make reparation for its consequences. If national law does not allow – or allows only partial – reparation to be made, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate (see Iatridis v. Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 31107/96, §§ 32-33, ECHR 2000-XI). In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant can now file a petition under section 428a of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph 31 above) with the Vojnić Municipal Court for the reopening of the civil proceedings in respect of which the Court has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.", "79.  Given the nature of the applicant's complaint and the reasons for which it has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, the Court considers that in the present case the most appropriate form of redress would be to reopen the proceedings complained of in due course (see, mutatis mutandis, Trgo v. Croatia, no. 35298/04, § 75, 11 June 2009, and Vrbica v. , no. 32540/05, §§ 83-85, 1 April 2010).", "80.  Having regard to the foregoing, and given that the applicant did not submit a claim for just satisfaction at the time prescribed, the Court considers that there is no call to award him any sum on that account.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Declares the complaint concerning the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 29 March 2011, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tSøren Nielsen\tAnatoly Kovler\n\tRegistrar\tPresident"]}
