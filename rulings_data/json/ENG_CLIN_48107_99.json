In 1996, the applicant church brought an action against the Sâmbăta Orthodox Church for the purpose of receiving authorisation to use the local church building, which had belonged to it prior to 1948, for religious services. The applicant church won its case at first instance and on appeal. However, the court of appeal found against it in a judgment of January 1998, declaring its request inadmissible.
