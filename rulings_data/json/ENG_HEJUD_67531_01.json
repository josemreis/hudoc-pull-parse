In particular, he alleges that he was released almost two years after his health had improved. In his submissions he refers to Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant provides as follows:", "“Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.”", "A.  Submissions of the parties", "35.  The Government submitted that compulsory medical treatment could only be ordered by a court resolution. This could be appealed in cassation under Article 424 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, within seven days from the date of the adoption of the resolution. An appeal could be lodged by a defence lawyer, whose participation in such cases was obligatory. The Government pointed out that the applicant had used this possibility regarding his continued detention. Moreover, the rejection of his appeals did not mean that the remedy was ineffective. The issue of the applicant’s compulsory medical treatment was examined by the domestic courts on six occasions on the basis of the applications lodged after his medical examinations by competent doctors. Given the frequency of the revision of the lawfulness of the applicant’s compulsory medical treatment, the Government considered that Article 5 § 4 had not been breached.", "36.  The applicant disagreed. In particular, he alleged that the appeal procedure was not effective. He mentioned that it was only the doctor of the psychiatric institution, but not the applicant himself, who could lodge an application with the court seeking annulment of the relevant measures. Furthermore, he maintained that, even though his state of health had improved, the domestic courts unlawfully refused to release him from the psychiatric hospital for almost two years.", "B.  The case-law of the Court", "37.  The Court notes in respect of the detention of persons of unsound mind (Article 5 § 1(e) of the Convention) that they “may be deprived of their liberty either in order to be given medical treatment or because of considerations dictated by social policy, or on both medical and social grounds ... [A] predominant reason why the Convention allows the persons mentioned in Article 5 § 1(e) to be deprived of their liberty is not only that they are dangerous for public safety, but also that their own interests may necessitate their detention” (see Litwa v. Poland, no. 26629/95, § 60, ECHR 2000-III). The dangerousness factor is of particular relevance to the present case since the applicant, whilst “mentally deranged”, committed serious offences against the physical integrity of other persons.", "38.  The Court reiterates that the object and purpose of Article 5 § 1, which is the lex generalis in relation to Article 5 § 4, is to ensure that no one should be deprived of his/her liberty in an arbitrary fashion; consequently, quite apart from conformity with domestic law, “no detention that is arbitrary can ever be regarded as lawful” (see Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, judgment of 24 October 1979, Series A no. 33, pp. 16 and 18, §§ 37 and 39).", "39.  The Court observes that, in accordance with its case law, the person subjected to compulsory medical treatment should have access to a court and the opportunity to be heard either in person or through some form of representation (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, §§ 73-76, and the Winterwerp judgment, cited above, §§ 60 and 61). The Article 5 § 4 review is not required to be automatic, but should rather be an opportunity for proceedings to be taken by the patient himself or herself (see, inter alia, De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, cited above; Keus v. the Netherlands, judgment of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 185-C).", "40.  Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 § 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation (see Megyeri v. Germany, judgment of 12 May 1992, Series A no. 237-A, p. 11, § 22), it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question. In particular, in the proceedings in which an appeal against a detention order is being examined, “equality of arms” between the parties, the prosecutor and the detained person must be ensured (see Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, § 59, 25 March 1999).", "’s assessment", "1.  General considerations as to the lawfulness of the applicant’s confinement in a psychiatric hospital", "41.  In the instant case, the Court observes that the applicant was subjected to compulsory medical treatment on the order of a competent court, following the court’s findings on two occasions that he had committed attempted rape. There is nothing in the case file to suggest that the domestic authorities did not comply with the requirements of the Convention when imposing this measure on the applicant. Moreover, even when the applicant’s health was deemed to have improved, no longer necessitating close or strict supervision, some lesser form of supervision was still deemed necessary. The Court notes that the initial imposition of compulsory medical treatment on the applicant is not at issue here, having been declared inadmissible by this Court’s final admissibility decision in relation to Article 5 § 1 (a) and (e). However, a problem arises in relation to the procedure for terminating the detention measure under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention (see Gorshkov v. Ukraine, no. 67531/01, decision of 15 June 2004; Rakevich v. Russia, no. 58973/00, judgment of 28 October 2003).", "2.  The procedure for terminating measures of compulsory medical treatment", "42.  Until April 2000, Ukrainian legislation did not foresee regular judicial review of the lawfulness of the continued, compulsory detention of persons of unsound mind (paragraph 29 above). However, since April 2000, the law has provided for frequent reviews of this matter, which are held at least every six months. The statutory provision allows the head doctor of the medical institution concerned, acting within his discretionary powers, to apply to a court, seeking the continuation, termination or modification of the measure. This application by a doctor, in accordance with Article 422 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, must be supported by the opinion of a medical commission made up of qualified psychiatrists (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above). However, the reviews (which are dealt with by the court which originally ordered the compulsory treatment), as required by paragraph 43 of the Rules of the Strict Security Psychiatric Hospitals of the Ministry of Health, approved by Order No. 397 of 8 October 2001 of the Ministry of Health, are conducted only if there are doubts as to the persistence of the patient’s mental illness (see paragraph 33 above).", "43.  In the event that the court has doubts as to the medical opinion on the patient’s mental state, it has the power to order another medical examination, but is not bound by the latter’s conclusions. In case of necessity or particular doubts, the court can summon the expert-psychiatrist or the patient concerned to participate in the hearing of the case. However, the Court would underline that the participation of the person already undergoing compulsory medical treatment at the hearing is apparently not obligatory. The scope of a patient’s competence in such proceedings is limited, since he/she is not a party to them. Furthermore, there appears to be only an implicit right of appeal against a court decision in these matters (Article 424 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, paragraph 31 above; the Government’s submission paragraph 35 above).", "3.  Conclusions of the Court", "44.  The Court reiterates that a key guarantee under Article 5 § 4 is that a patient compulsorily detained for psychiatric treatment must have the right to seek judicial review on his or her own motion (see, e.g., Musial v. Poland, judgment of 25 March 1999, Reports 1999-II, § 43; the aforementioned Rakevich v. Russia judgment, § 45). Article 5 § 4 therefore requires, in the first place, an independent legal device by which the detainee may appear before a judge who will determine the lawfulness of the continued detention. The detainee’s access to the judge should not depend on the good will of the detaining authority, activated at the discretion of the medical corps or the hospital administration.", "45.  Whilst the legal mechanism contained in sections 19-22 of the Psychiatric Medical Assistance Act and Chapter 34 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in force at the material time (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above), ensuring that a mental health patient is brought before a judge automatically, constitutes an important safeguard against arbitrary detention, it is insufficient on its own. Such surplus guarantees do not eliminate the need for an independent right of individual application by the patient.", "46.  The Court concludes that the applicant was not entitled to take proceedings to test the lawfulness of his continued detention for compulsory medical treatment by a court, as required by Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. There has, accordingly, been a violation of this provision.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION", "47.  The Court recalls that the applicant did not complain under Article 13 of the Convention, but that it was the Court itself who raised the matter ex officio. However, in view of the considerations and conclusions above under Article 5 § 4, the Court now finds the Article 13 issue superfluous. Accordingly, it is not necessary to make a separate examination of the applicant’s complaint under this provision.", "III.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "48.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "49.  The applicant, notwithstanding the requests of the Registry of 23 June 2003 and 1 December 2004, did not submit any claims for just satisfaction in accordance with Rule 60 of the Rules of Court.
