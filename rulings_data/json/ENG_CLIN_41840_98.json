In January 1970, the case-file was transferred to the Minister of Finance, who ruled that the applicant was not entitled to a war invalid’s pension. In June 1971, he lodged a second appeal with the Court of Audit, seeking to have that ruling quashed. In 1989 Principal State Counsel filed final submissions in both cases and asked for them to be joined. In March 1992, the Court of Audit gave a judgment in which it found partly for the applicant, severed the second case and transferred it to the Division dealing with war pensions. The applicant maintains that he did not know of this judgment until November 1997 since the court registry apparently failed to inform him of the date it was deposited (August 1992). In January 1993, the Division sent the applicant a copy of the operative provisions of that judgment. Proceedings in the Court of Audit are governed by the ordinary rules of civil procedure, including the rule on res judicata. Since the whole judgment had not been served on the applicant, the issues decided in it became res judicata one year and 45 days after it had been deposited with the registry, namely in September 1993.
