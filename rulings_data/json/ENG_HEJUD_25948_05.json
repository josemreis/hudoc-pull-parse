The Rules of Court contain no requirement for powers of attorney to be drawn up in accordance with the national legislation (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia (dec.), no. 57942/00 and no. 57945/00, 19 December 2002). In these circumstances, the Court has no grounds to doubt the validity of the power of authority issued by the applicant to his representative. Accordingly, the Government’s objection must be dismissed.", "C.  Request to strike out the application", "76.  The Government noted that when the application was communicated by the Court, they received the application form, dated 16 August 2005, together with annexes to the application form which were dated 21, 27 and 28 August 2005. The Government submitted that “if the application and annexes to it were lodged with the Court in the same form as they were received by the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, the Russian Federation authorities ask the Court to strike the present application out of the list of cases examined by the Court, since a number of annexes were evidently issued later than the application form, this proving that the Court is being intentionally mislead”.", "77.  The Court is unable to discern the basis of the Government’s request to strike out the application. In any event, it finds no grounds to doubt the validity of the applicant’s submissions. Accordingly, the Government’s request must be dismissed.", "D.  Alleged abuse of the right of application", "78.  In the Government’s view, the applicant’s contentions that the medical assistance available to him had not been adequate amounted to an abuse of the right of application within the meaning of Article 35 § 3.", "79.  The Court reiterates that, except in extraordinary cases, an application may only be rejected as abusive if it was knowingly based on untrue facts (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV, \n§§ 53-54; I.S. v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 32438/96, 6 April 2000; and Varbanov v. Bulgaria, no. 31365/96, § 36, ECHR 2000X).", "80.  Having regard to the statements made by the applicant in the present case, the Court does not consider that they amount to an abuse of the right of petition. Accordingly the Government’s objection is dismissed.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 3 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE ALLEGED \nILL-TREATMENT IN LGOV CORRECTIONAL COLONY OX-30/3, LGOV REMAND PRISON IZ-46/2 AND BRYANSK REMAND PRISON IZ-32/1 AND THE LACK OF AN ADEQUATE INVESTIGATION", "81.  Relying on Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention, the applicant complained that he had been systematically ill-treated in Lgov correctional colony OX-30/3, which had compelled him to inflict self-injury. He also alleged that the investigation into his allegations had not been effective. The applicant further complained that he had been subjected to psychological pressure and torture in Lgov remand prison IZ-46/2 and remand prison \nIZ-32/1, Bryansk Region, and that there had also been no adequate investigation into these allegations. The relevant Convention articles provide:", "Article 3", "“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”", "Article 13", "“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”", "A.  Admissibility", "82.  The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies and that his complaints were unsubstantiated. Physical force had been applied to the applicant by prison officials on only one occasion, namely on 23 March 2005 when he had resisted a routine search. The use of force had been justified. As to the applicant’s other allegations of ill-treatment, they had been carefully examined by prosecuting authorities and found unsubstantiated. In particular, a dog had never been set on him. All the injuries that had been found by prison doctors had been inflicted by the applicant on himself. During his imprisonment the applicant had been regularly seen by a psychologist, who had diagnosed him as suffering from an emotionally unstable personality disorder. In his psychological profile, prepared by the head of the psychological laboratory of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences, the applicant was described as having an inclination to self-mutilation as a way of avoiding prison regulations and opposing the prison administration. During the night of 26-27 June 2005 it was the applicant who had incited the other inmates of Lgov correctional colony OX-30/3 to commit self-mutilation. He had not been granted the status of a victim in criminal investigation no. 1519, and his complaint concerning the alleged ill-treatment in the colony had been dismissed. The applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment had been properly investigated by the prosecuting authorities, who had examined the relevant medical certificates and other documents and had questioned numerous witnesses, including the applicant’s cellmates, prison officers and medical experts. Therefore, in the Government’s view, the applicant’s complaints under Articles 3 and 13 were totally unsubstantiated.", "83.  The applicant contested the Government’s submissions. He reiterated his allegations that he had been subjected to ill-treatment throughout his detention. He had been regularly beaten in correctional colony OX-30/3 for his refusal to join the “order section” and subsequently, after his transfer from the prison, in order to be forced to withdraw his complaints to the domestic prosecuting authorities and the Court. The applicant further submitted that the investigation into his allegations had not been adequate because the persons questioned by the prosecutors had had an interest in denying that he had been subjected to ill-treatment. The applicant further submitted that his complaints concerning the actions of prison officials had not been sent to the addressees. Therefore, he had not failed to exhaust domestic remedies; rather, there had been no effective remedies. In sum, the applicant insisted that there had been a violation of Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention on account on ill-treatment in the detention facility and the lack of an adequate investigation.", "84.  As regards the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 § 1 also requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements laid down in domestic law, but not that recourse should be had to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2275-76, §§ 51-52, and Akdıvar and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996-IV, p. 1210, §§ 65-67). It is also established that a mere doubt as to the prospect of success is not sufficient to exempt an applicant from submitting a complaint to the competent authority (see Whiteside v. the United Kingdom, decision of 7 March 1994, application no. 20357/92, DR 76, p. 80).", "85.  The Court further emphasises that the application of the exhaustion rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means in particular that the Court must take realistic account, not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned, but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust domestic remedies (see Akdivar and Others cited above, § 69, and Yaşa v. Turkey, judgment of 2 September 1998, Reports 1998VI, p. 2432, § 77).", "86.  The Court notes that under Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, decisions by investigators and prosecutors that might infringe the constitutional rights of participants in proceedings or prevent access to a court may be appealed to a court. The Court observes that although a court itself had no competence to institute criminal proceedings, its power to annul a refusal to institute criminal proceedings and indicate the defects to be addressed appears to be a substantial safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of powers by the investigating authority (see Trubnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 49790/99, 14 October 2003). Therefore, in the ordinary course of events such an appeal might be regarded as a possible remedy where the prosecution decided not to investigate the claims.", "87.  Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that the applicant filed several complaints before the prosecuting authorities concerning the alleged ill-treatment in Lgov correctional colony OX-30/3. The Lgov Interdistrict Prosecutor’s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings following the applicant’s first complaint on 10 July 2005. In relation to the applicant’s second complaint, the Prosecutor’s Office of the Seymskiy District of Kursk initially refused to institute criminal proceedings on 14 July 2005. After this decision was quashed by a higher prosecutor, the institution of criminal proceedings was again refused on 5 September 2005. On 19 August 2005 the Prosecutor’s Office of the Kursk Region discontinued criminal investigation no. 1519, instituted into the events that took place in the colony on 26-27 June 2005, in the part related to the complaints lodged by the applicant. Although the three decisions could be appealed against to a court, however, the applicant did not avail himself of that avenue.", "88.  The Court further notes that the applicant lodged two complaints with the prosecuting authorities concerning the alleged ill-treatment in Lgov remand prison IZ-46/2. The Prosecutor’s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to his first complaint on 18 July 2005. In relation to the applicant’s second complaint, the Prosecutor’s Office initially refused to institute criminal proceedings on 1 September 2005. After this decision was quashed by a higher prosecutor, the institution of criminal proceedings was again refused on 15 September 2005. The Prosecutor’s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings following the applicant’s complaint concerning the alleged ill-treatment in  remand prison IZ-32/1 on 21 October 2005. The Court observes that the three decisions could have been appealed to a court, but the applicant did not take this course.", "89.  In principle, the Court recognises the vulnerability of detainees and the difficulty that they face in pursuing complex legal proceedings. These considerations may be taken into account in the flexible approach to be adopted in such circumstances. However, in the present case the Court finds no reasons to dispense the applicant from exhausting a domestic remedy that was available to him. The Court notes that, throughout the proceedings, the applicant was assisted by a lawyer, who could have advised him to challenge the prosecutor’s decisions to a court. Furthermore, the applicant did not explain why, having received five refusals from the prosecuting authorities to institute criminal proceedings into his allegations of \nill-treatment and a decision to discontinue criminal proceedings in relation to his complaint, he did not take such action, and the materials of the case contain no indication that it was impossible or even impractical (see Slyusarev v. Russia (dec.), no. 60333/00, 9 November 2006).", "90.  Therefore, the Court concludes that the applicant failed to exhaust available domestic remedies with regard to his complaint under Article 3 of the Convention.", "91.  As regards the applicant’s complaint under Article 13 of the Convention, the Court refers to its findings above that the applicant had an effective domestic remedy in respect of his complaints under Article 3, which he failed to have recourse to. Accordingly, the applicant’s complaint under Article 13 of the Convention is manifestly ill-founded.", "92.  It follows that this part of the application should be rejected pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.", "III.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 2 AND 3 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF ALLEGED LACK OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN LGOV CORRECTIONAL COLONY OX-30/3, LGOV REMAND PRISON IZ-46/2 AND BRYANSK REMAND PRISON IZ-32/1", "93.  The applicant complained that he had not been provided with adequate medical assistance following his self-infliction of injuries in Lgov correctional colony OX-30/3 and later in Lgov remand prison IZ-46/2 and  remand prison IZ-32/1. He relied on Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention in this respect. The Court will examine the complaint under Article 3.", "A.  Admissibility", "94.  The Government contested the applicant’s argument. They submitted firstly that all of the applicant’s self-inflicted injuries had been subcutaneous. He had sustained no penetrating wounds. The applicant had always been provided with medical aid on the numerous occasions that he had self-mutilated. His slash wounds had been properly dressed with aseptic bandages and the foreign bodies that he had thrust into himself had been removed. The applicant had been seen in good time by a doctor and, in particular, by a surgeon when required. On several occasions the applicant had refused medical examination or treatment, which was reflected in his medical file. However, adequate medical aid had been made available to him at all times. The Government sent pictures of the applicant’s body which, they alleged, had been taken at the applicant’s request for submission to the Court. In their view, the pictures confirmed that the applicant’s wounds had been properly treated by medical specialists and had healed.", "95.  The applicant insisted that he had not been provided with adequate medical assistance. He contended that the Government’s submissions were not accurate as he had had penetrating and not subcutaneous wounds. The applicant claimed that on a number of occasions he had been forced to refuse medical aid. He had also had to remove foreign objects from his body himself because medical assistance had not been available. Surgeons had never removed them, and if there were entries in his medical file to that effect, it meant that they were forged.", "96.  The Court reiterates that Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the most fundamental values of democratic society. It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the circumstances and the victim’s behaviour (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no 26772/95, § 119, ECHR 2000-IV). However, to fall under Article 3 of the Convention, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Valašinas v. Lithuania, no. 44558/98, §§ 100–101, ECHR 2001-VIII).", "97.  Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court notes firstly that the applicant did not submit any evidence to support his allegations that certain entries in his medical file had been forged or that some information provided therein had been inaccurate. Therefore, in the following analysis the Court will have due regard to the applicant’s medical file.", "98.  As regards the ill-treatment that the applicant alleged had taken place on 23 May 2005, the Government submitted that the applicant had never applied for medical aid in this connection. The Court notes that the applicant’s medical file contains no indication that he had applied for medical aid, and the applicant did not submit any evidence to the contrary.", "99.  As regards the injuries self-inflicted by the applicant during the night on 26-27 June 2005 in correctional colony OX-30/3, the Court notes that, within a short space of time, the applicant underwent an X-ray and was seen by a surgeon, who removed the foreign object, an electrode, from his body and dressed the wounds. In the materials available to the Court there is nothing to support the applicant’s allegation that some parts of the electrode remained in his body. Accordingly, the Court finds that the medical aid provided to the applicant was adequate to his condition.", "100.  The Court notes that during the applicant’s placement in Lgov remand prison IZ-46/2 he was diagnosed with subcutaneous wounds on 29 June, 11 and 23 July 2005. The applicant’s wounds were dressed daily between 30 June and 14 July 2005 and then on 16, 23 and 25 July 2005. On 16 July 2005, because of the intumescence on his right forearm, the applicant was given antibiotics. On the same date he was offered surgical treatment for the wounds, which, according to the entry in his medical file, he refused. On 25 July 2005 the applicant refused stitching for the wound in the area of the right elbow joint.", "101.  The Court observes that the applicant submitted no evidence to support his allegation that he had penetrating rather than subcutaneous wounds. Likewise, the Court has no evidence to conclude that the applicant was forced to refuse medical aid. It therefore finds that the medical assistance available to the applicant in remand prison IZ-46/2 was sufficient.", "102.  The Court further notes that during the applicant’s placement in  remand prison IZ-32/1 he complained about pain in his stomach on 17 August 2005. The doctor suspected that he had a foreign body in his stomach; however, the applicant refused to have it palpated. The applicant was again seen by a doctor and refused palpation of his stomach on 22, 24 and 26 August 2005. After fluorography conducted on the latter date showed a nail in the applicant’s abdominal area, he agreed to have his stomach palpated on 27 August 2005. On the same date he was transported to a hospital of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences in order to have the nail removed. However, on his arrival at the hospital he refused medical treatment and two days later removed the nail himself. Doctors dressed his wound. On 31 August 2005 a doctor dressed the wounds on the applicant’s right forearm, self-inflicted on an earlier date. Between 14 and 26 September 2005 the applicant was placed in hospital for removal of another foreign body in his abdominal area and subsequent treatment.", "103.  The Court observes that the applicant submitted no evidence to support his allegation that he had been forced to refuse medical aid. The materials available to the Court show that qualified medical assistance was made available to him both in the remand prison and in hospitals outside the detention facility. However, he refused it on several occasions. Inasmuch as the applicant may be understood to allege that the medical aid was not provided in good time, the Court considers that the State may not be held responsible for the delays caused by the applicant’s own refusal to undergo medical examinations or accept treatment. It finds that the medical aid available to the applicant was sufficient in the circumstances.", "104.  It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.", "IV.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WITH THE APPLICANT’S CORRESPONDENCE", "105.  The applicant complained under Article 8 that all his correspondence had been read by State officials and that a large number of his complaints and applications to various State authorities and a letter to his counsel, Ms Liptser, had not been sent to the addressees at all. He referred to Rule 12 of the 2001 Internal Regulations in support of his complaint. Article 8 of the Convention provides as follows:", "“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.", "2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”", "A.  Admissibility", "106.  The Government submitted that the applicant’s right to correspondence had been restricted in accordance with Article 91 § 2 of the Penal Code. However, the scope of the right as guaranteed by this provision had not been violated. The Government averred that all the applicant’s letters to the law-enforcement agencies, the Ombudsman, bar associations, his counsel and the Court had been sent to the addressees. The Government enclosed extracts of postal registers kept at Lgov remand prison IZ-46/2, remand prison IZ-46/1, Kursk Region, and correctional colony no. 11, Khabarovsk Region, pertaining to the applicant’s correspondence. They also submitted that during his placement in remand prison IZ-46/1 the applicant had received a letter and two postal packets. The Government contended that there had been no interference with the applicant’s correspondence.", "107.  The applicant maintained his allegations that his complaints to the law-enforcement agencies and a letter to his counsel had not been sent to the addressees by prison officers. He noted that, although the Government presented evidence that some of his letters had been sent, they did not prove that all of them had been sent. Furthermore, in the applicant’s view the Government failed to reply directly as to whether his correspondence had been subject to censorship.", "108.  The Court reiterates that any “interference by a public authority” with the right to respect for correspondence will contravene Article 8 of the Convention unless it is “in accordance with the law”, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article and is “necessary in a democratic society” in order to achieve them (see, among many other authorities, the following judgments: Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 32, § 84; Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, Series A no. 233, p. 16, § 34; and Niedbała v. , no. 27915/95, § 78, 4 July 2000).", "109.  The Court notes the applicant’s complaint relates to the period when the 2001 Internal Regulations, which provided that all letters dispatched by detainees should be handed over to prison officers in unsealed envelopes, were still in force. The Court observes, however, that the provisions in the Regulations were subordinate to the Penal Code, which provides in Article 91 § 2 that detainees’ correspondence with courts, prosecutors, penitentiary officials, the Ombudsman, the public monitoring board and the Court was not subject to censorship. Correspondence with counsel was not subject to censorship except where authorised by a reasoned decision by the head of the correctional facility or his deputy, based on reliable information that the correspondence was aimed at initiating, planning or organising a crime.", "110.  The Court notes that, according to the postal registers submitted by the Government, twelve letters and complaints by the applicant were sent to various recipients from remand prison IZ-46/2 and eight letters and complaints from remand prison IZ-46/1. The Court observes that the applicant submitted no evidence that the 2001 Internal Regulations had been applied to him in disregard of the relevant provisions of the Penal Code. Likewise he failed to furnish any evidence that any of his letters had not been sent to the addressees or at least to submit specific details of the letters which, he alleged, had not been dispatched by the administration of the relevant detention facilities.", "111.  It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.", "V.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 34 OF THE CONVENTION", "112.  The applicant further complained under Article 34 of the Convention that State officials had forced him to write a statement on withdrawal of his application before the Court, which was later sent to the Court by the Government. Article 34 of the Convention reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "“The Court may receive applications from any person ... claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.”", "113.  The Government contested the applicant’s submissions. They stated that his allegations of ill-treatment had been reviewed by domestic prosecuting authorities and found to be unsubstantiated.", "114.  The applicant maintained his complaint.", "115.  Having regard to paragraph 72 above, the Court will now proceed to examine the applicant’s complaint under Article 34 of the Convention in the light of the general principles established in its case law. The Court reiterates that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition instituted by Article 34 that applicants or potential applicants should be able to communicate freely with the Court without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints (see, among other authorities, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, cited above, § 105, and Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2288, § 105). In this context, “pressure” includes not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from pursuing a Convention remedy (see Kurt v. Turkey, judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998III, p. 1192, § 159).", "116.  Furthermore, whether or not contacts between the authorities and an applicant are tantamount to unacceptable practices from the standpoint of Article 34 must be determined in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. In this respect, regard must be had to the vulnerability of the complainant and his or her susceptibility to influence exerted by the authorities (see the Akdivar and Others and Kurt judgments, cited above, p. 1219, § 105, and pp. 1192-93, § 160, respectively). The applicant’s position might be particularly vulnerable when he is held in custody with limited contacts with his family or the outside world (see Cotleţ v. Romania, no. 38565/97, § 71, 3 June 2003).", "117.  The Court notes that on 11 August 2005 the applicant told his counsel that he had been forced by State officials to write statements on withdrawal of his application before the Court. The applicant submitted that such statements should be regarded as invalid, as they had been written under pressure. On the following day the applicant’s counsel informed the Court accordingly. The Court then transmitted the applicant’s submissions to the Government. On 11 November 2005 the Government sent the Court a copy of the applicant’s statement of 5 August 2005, addressed to the Representative of the  at the Court, Mr Laptev. In the statement the applicant asked Mr Laptev to recall his application from the Court. In their letter sent together with the applicant’s statement, the Government contended that it had been written by the applicant voluntarily and his allegations that it had been written under pressure from State agents were unsubstantiated. The Government asked the Court to assess the applicant’s locus standi in the proceedings in view of this statement, which the Court has addressed above.", "118.  The Court observes that the applicant informed the Court that the statement dated 5 August 2005 had been written by him under pressure, asked the Court to disregard it should it be received and confirmed his intention to pursue the proceedings. The Court is astonished that after these submissions had been transmitted to the Government, they sent the Court the applicant’s statement of 5 August 2005 and, moreover, insisted that it had been written by him voluntarily. In the Court’s view, such conduct on the part of the Government was not consistent with their obligation not to interfere with the applicant’s right of individual petition.", "119.  The respondent State has therefore failed to comply with its obligations under Article 34 of the Convention.", "VI.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "120.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "121.  The applicant claimed 35,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage caused by the physical and moral sufferings he had sustained.", "122.  The Government considered the claim to be unsubstantiated. In their view, should the Court find a violation of the applicant’s rights in the present case, such a finding should constitute sufficient just satisfaction.", "123.  Having regard to the nature of the breach in this case, and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court holds that the finding of the State’s failure to comply with its obligations under Article 34 of the Convention constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for the nonpecuniary damage, if any, sustained by the applicant.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "124.  The applicant also claimed EUR 3,000 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court and, in particular, for the assistance of his representative who acted pro bono and visited him in the detention facilities.", "125.  The Government argued that the claim should be rejected altogether since the applicant failed to submit any documents to support his claim that the costs had actually been incurred (see Rotaru v.  [GC], no. 28341/95, ECHR 2000V).", "126.  The Court notes that in the present case the applicant did not furnish any documents to show that he had actually incurred the expenses claimed. Therefore, regard being had to the information in its possession, the Court rejects the applicant’s claim for costs and expenses.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Dismisses the Government’s preliminary objections;", "", "2.  Decides to proceed with the examination of the applicant’s complaint under Article 34 and declares the remainder of the application inadmissible;", "", "3.  Holds that the State has failed to fulfil its obligation under Article 34 not to hinder the effective exercise of the right of individual petition;", "", "4.  Dismisses the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 8 November 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tSøren Nielsen\tLoukis Loucaides\n\tRegistrar\tPresident"]}
