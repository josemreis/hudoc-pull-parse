In the alternative the Government argued that the applicant had failed to lodge his constitutional complaint with the  within the thirty-day time-limit, and that the State could not be held responsible for that. Had he, however, considered that there had been a justified reason for his omission, he could have asked for reinstatement of the proceedings.", "25.  The applicant contested that view. He argued that he had asked the  to rectify its decision but had received a reply stating that that court was not in a position to rectify its decision and that it was open to him to lodge an application with the Court.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "26.  The Court firstly reiterates that the requirements contained in Article 35 § 1 concerning exhaustion of domestic remedies and the six-month period are closely interrelated, since not only are they combined in the same Article, but they are also expressed in a single sentence whose grammatical construction implies such a correlation (see Hatjianastasiou v. Greece, no. 12945/87, Commission decision of 4 April 1990, and Berdzenishvili v. Russia (dec.), no. 31697/03, ECHR 2004II (extracts).", "27.  As a rule, the six-month period runs from the date of the final decision in the process of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Article 35 § 1 cannot be interpreted in a manner which would require an applicant to inform the Court of his complaint before final settlement of his position on the matter at the domestic level. In this respect the Court has already held that before bringing complaints against Croatia to the Court, in order to comply with the principle of subsidiarity applicants are in principle required to afford the Croatian Constitutional Court the opportunity to remedy their situation (see Orlić v. Croatia, no. 48833/07, § 46, 21 June 2011).", "28. This is because the Court may only deal with an application after all domestic remedies have been exhausted. The purpose of Article 35 is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to it (see, for example, Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, § 15, ECHR 2002-VIII). The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies, however, requires an applicant to make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his Convention grievances. To be effective, a remedy must be capable of remedying directly the impugned state of affairs (see Balogh v. Hungary, no. 47940/99, § 30, 20 July 2004).", "29.  The Court notes that on the day the applicant received the Constitutional Court’s decision of 18 December 2008, he informed the Constitutional Court that there had been an error in the calculation of the time-limit for lodging the constitutional complaint, and asked that the error be rectified. In addition, when he did not receive an answer from that court, he sent another letter on 2 February 2009, again asking that the error be rectified. Only later, on 2 December 2009, did the applicant receive a reply from the  stating that that court was not in a position to rectify its decision of 18 December 2008, and that it was open to the applicant to lodge an application with the Court. The applicant followed that instruction and lodged his application with the Court on 15 March 2010.", "30.  Having regard to Section 66 of the Constitutional Court Act, the Court considers that it cannot be held against the applicant that he asked the Constitutional Court to take appropriate steps to rectify possible errors in its procedure before lodging his complaint with the Court.", "31.  Against the above background, the Court considers that, in the circumstances of the present case, the applicant exhausted all available domestic remedies and that the running of the six-month time-limit should be calculated from 2 December 2009 on which date he was informed of the Constitutional Court’s position. The present application was lodged on 15 March 2010. It follows that the Government’s objections must be rejected.", "32.  The Court considers that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The parties’ arguments", "33.  The applicant submitted that he had lodged his constitutional complaint against the appeal judgment of the Pula County Court of 19 November 2007 within the thirty-day time-limit. He argued that he had received that judgment on 12 September 2008, as confirmed by the letter from the Pula Municipal Court, and that he had lodged his constitutional complaint on 11 October 2008. As to the date of 10 December 2007, which the  considered to be the date of service of the appeal judgment, the applicant pointed out that this was the date of service of another decision of the Pula County Court.", "34.  The Government argued that the applicant had received the appeal judgment of the  on 10 December 2007, since the service note of 10 December 2007 stated that a “second-instance decision of 23 November 2007” had been served on the applicant. As to the date of 12 September 2008, they stressed that this was the date of service of a subsequent Pula County Court decision of 7 April 2008, concerning the applicant’s objection to the order to pay the courts’ fees. The service note of 12 September 2008 stated that a “second-instance judgment and second-instance decision” had been served on the applicant’s counsel, which meant that the appeal judgment had been served again on the applicant. However, when calculating the thirty-day time-limit for lodging the constitutional complaint against the appeal judgment, only the first service had to be taken into account.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "(a)  General principles", "35.  The Court has held on many occasions that Article 6 § 1 embodies the “right to court”, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before a court, constitutes one aspect only; however, it is an aspect that makes it in fact possible to benefit from the further guarantees laid down in paragraph 1 of Article 6. The fair, public and expeditious characteristics of judicial proceedings are indeed of no value at all if such proceedings are not first initiated. And in civil matters one can scarcely conceive of the rule of law without access to the courts being possible (see, among many other authorities, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 January 1975, §§ 34 in fine and 35-36, Series A no. 18; Z. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, §§ 9193, ECHR 2001-V; and Kreuz, cited above, § 52).", "36.  The right of access to court is not, however, absolute. It may be subject to legitimate restrictions such as statutory limitation periods, security for costs orders, and regulations concerning minors and persons of unsound mind (see Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom, 22 October 1996, §§ 5152, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV; Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom, 13 July 1995, §§ 6267, Series A no. 316-B; and Golder, cited above, § 39). Where the individual’s access is limited, either by operation of law or in fact, the Court will examine whether the limitation imposed impaired the essence of the right and, in particular, whether it pursued a legitimate aim and whether there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 57, Series A no. 93; Związek Nauczycielstwa Polskiego v. Poland, no. 42049/98, § 29, ECHR 2004IX; and Szwagrun-Baurycza v. Poland, no. 41187/02, § 49, 24 October 2006). If the restriction is compatible with these principles, no violation of Article 6 will arise (see Z and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, §§ 9293).", "37.  In this respect the Court reiterates that, in accordance with Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the obligations undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court, unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see Běleš and Others v. the , no. 47273/99, § 48, ECHR 2002IX).", "(b)  Application of these principles to the present case", "38.  The Court firstly observes that the present case concerns a civil dispute between private parties in relation to possession of a house and a plot of land. The applicant lodged his constitutional complaint with the  complaining about arbitrary application of the relevant domestic law by the lower courts, which had an adverse determinative effect on his property rights in the civil proceedings. He asked the  to quash the judgments of the lower courts and to order a retrial.", "39.  The Constitutional Court was therefore called upon to consider the applicant’s civil rights and obligations and a constitutional complaint was an available and effective remedy against the appeal judgment of the Pula County Court, which could have been used in the ordinary course of exhaustion of the domestic remedies concerning the property disputes (see, for example, Gottwald-Markušić v. Croatia (dec.), no. 49049/06, 30 March 2010). Relatedly, although he did have access to the Pula Municipal Court and the Pula County Court, the right to access to the Constitutional Court formed an indispensible part of the applicant’s right to obtain a “determination” of his property dispute by a court (see, mutatis mutandis, Kutić v. Croatia, no. 48778/99, § 25, ECHR 2002II, and Menshakova v. , no. 377/02, § 52, 8 April 2010).", "40.  The Court observes that section 64 of the Constitutional Court Act provides for a thirty-day time-limit within which a constitutional complaint has to be lodged with the , and that this time-limit runs from the service of the final court decision.", "41.  The Court notes that in the present case the final court decision in the civil proceedings was the appeal judgment of the Pula County Court of 19 November 2007. This appeal judgment, according to the written confirmation from the Pula Municipal Court, was served on the applicant’s counsel on 12 September 2008. In addition to this, the Court also notes that the Pula Municipal Court service note of 12 September 2008 states that the title of the document to be served on the applicant is “second-instance judgment and second-instance decision”.", "42.  In this respect, the Court cannot accept the Government’s argument that the appeal judgment was served on the applicant’s counsel on 10 December 2007. Namely, not only that it appears contrary to the Pula Municipal Court document, it also does not correspond to the service note of that date, which states that the title of the document to be served on the applicant is “second-instance decision of 23 November 2007” without any mention of the second-instance judgment.", "43.  Against the above background, the Court accepts that the appeal judgment of the , against which the applicant lodged his constitutional complaint, was served on the applicant on 12 September 2008. Since the applicant lodged his constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court on 11 October 2008, namely within the thirty-day time-limit, the Court notes that there was an obvious error and miscalculation of the time-limits by the Constitutional Court when declaring the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible as lodged out of time.", "44.  In these circumstances, the Court considers that the  erroneously declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible, depriving him of his right of access to court (see Demerdžieva and Others v. “the ”, no. 19315/06, § 26, 10 June 2010).", "45.  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION", "46.  The applicant complained that he did not have an effective remedy in respect of his complaint concerning access to court. He relied on Article 13 of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”", "Admissibility", "47.  The Government reiterated their arguments concerning exhaustion of domestic remedies already raised in respect of the applicant’s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention.", "48.  The applicant contested that view, arguing that since he had proved that his constitutional complaint had been lodged within the thirty-day time-limit, all the Government’s arguments were irrelevant.", "49.  The Court notes that the decision of the Constitutional Court of 18 December 2008, by which the applicant’s constitutional complaint was declared inadmissible, was a final decision in the course of the exhaustion of domestic remedies in .", "50.  In this respect the Court reiterates that Article 13 of the Convention does not as such guarantee the applicant a right to challenge this decision in further domestic proceedings once his case has been decided at the final level of jurisdiction (see Tregubenko v. Ukraine, no. 61333/00, 21 October 2003; Sitkov v. Russia (dec.), no. 55531/00, 9 November 2004; and Korolev v.  (dec.), no. 25551/05, ECHR 2010).", "51.  It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.", "III.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "52.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "53.  The applicant claimed 25,240 Croatian kunas (HRK) in respect of pecuniary damage, which corresponds to the amount he had paid after he had lost the case in the civil proceedings. He also invited the Court to award him a lump sum on account of non-pecuniary damage, according to its criteria.", "54.  The Government considered the applicant’s claim unfounded and unsubstantiated.", "55.  The Court does not see any causal link between the amount claimed for pecuniary damage and the finding of a violation, and therefore dismisses that claim.", "56.  As to the non-pecuniary damage, having regard to all the circumstances of the present case, the Court accepts that the applicant suffered non-pecuniary damage which cannot be compensated solely by the finding of a violation. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 6,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable to him.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "57.  The applicant asked the Court to award him an unspecified lump sum for costs and expenses.", "58.  The Court notes that the applicant failed to submit a specified claim for cost and expenses as provided under Rule 60 of the Rules of Court and as requested by the Court. Accordingly, the Court considers that there is no call to award him any sum on that account.", "C.  Default interest", "59.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Declares the complaint concerning access to court admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in that the applicant did not have access to the ;", "", "3.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 6,000 (six thousand euros), to be converted into Croatian kunas at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "4.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction and costs and expenses.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 23 October 2012, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tSøren Nielsen\tAnatoly Kovler\n\tRegistrar\tPresident"]}
