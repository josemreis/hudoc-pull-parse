The cell was not sufficiently lighted, was damp and had a poignant smell and mould.", "Due to the chronic diseases of the applicant, her personal physician insisted on strict diet, excluding any traces of eggs, meat or fatty foods. In order to prevent allergic disease the applicant’s physician also advised to limit the effect on the body of toxic compounds, including tobacco smoke, disinfectants and plastic utensils.", "The applicant could not consume any food provided by the SIZO due to her chronic gastroenterological diseases and allergies.

She refused the offer.", "On the moment of introducing her application to the Court, the applicant was entitled to take shower once per week and, according to her, bedding in her cell was not regularly changed.", "The applicant’s daily court hearings left her no time to seek medical assistance while in jail.

Some of the detention buildings had been constructed some 140 years previously. Three smaller, more recent blocks provided accommodation for sentenced working prisoners, women and juveniles. A new block for women was in the process of construction, but that process had virtually been halted due to lack of resources.", "With an official capacity of 2,950 places, on 8 September 2009 the establishment was holding 3,440 inmates, including 217 women and 69 juveniles. The vast majority of the inmate population was on remand. The establishment was also holding 297 inmates awaiting the outcome of their appeal (including 41 life-sentenced prisoners), 93 prisoners in transit and 100 sentenced inmates assigned to work in the prison’s general services and maintenance. Further, there were 11 inmates who had been subject to forensic psychiatric assessment and who were awaiting a final decision concerning their criminal responsibility. The prisoner population comprised 210 foreign national prisoners (of whom 170 were from countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States).", "Since 2001, following amendments to the CC, a section referred to as an “arrest house” had been set up for first-time offenders serving sentences of up to 6 months.", "101.  The vast majority of the cells holding male prisoners were seriously overcrowded (for example, 52 prisoners in a cell measuring some 50 m² and containing 40 beds; 32 prisoners in a cell measuring 33 m² and containing 20 beds). In some cells, the number of prisoners exceeded the number of beds available, and inmates took turns to sleep on the available beds or slept on the floor. The cells were packed with double bunk-beds, leaving very little space for any other furniture. In some cells, there were TV sets which belonged to the occupants.", "Because of the human mass, ventilation was almost non-existent and the cells were very hot and stuffy. The level of hygiene was also highly unsatisfactory: in some cells the delegation saw cockroaches, and prisoners also referred to the presence of mice and rats. The in-cell sanitary installations (a partitioned toilet and sink) were generally in a decrepit state and were clearly not sufficient for the numbers of inmates held in the larger cells.", "The negative consequences of the deplorable material conditions described above were compounded by the fact that some prisoners had spent lengthy periods of time at the SIZO (see paragraph 74). In the CPT’s view, the combination of negative factors to which a large number of prisoners were subjected at the Kyiv SIZO (overcrowding, appalling material conditions and levels of hygiene, and practically non-existent activity programmes) could easily be described as inhuman and degrading treatment.", "102.  The basement of the men’s detention block contained eight cells to which prisoners about to be transferred to other establishments were moved on the day of the transfer. The delegation saw 14 prisoners in a cell measuring 7 m² and equipped with benches along the walls; they complained that they had spent some 4 hours in the cell without being allowed to go to the toilet. Further, there were a number of cells for inmates transiting through the SIZO. These cells were dark, badly ventilated, overcrowded (e.g. 13 prisoners in a cell measuring 25 m²), damp and dilapidated.", "The delegation saw 18 waiting cells, referred to as “boxes”, which measured some 4 m² each, were equipped with small benches, had no access to natural light and were poorly ventilated. Prisoners alleged that they had been kept for up to 8 hours in such “boxes”, without access to a toilet and no food provision.", "It is also noteworthy that the seven cells in the “arrest house” had metal shutters attached to the windows which severely restricted access to natural light and fresh air. The delegation requested that these shutters be removed and was assured that this would be done without delay. By letter of 2 February 2010, the Ukrainian authorities confirmed that all the shutters had been removed from cell windows in the “arrest house” of the Kyiv SIZO. The CPT welcomes this step.", "103.  Material conditions prevailing in the section for women were somewhat better. In particular, the cells were less overcrowded (e.g. 6 inmates in a cell measuring 8 m²; 16 prisoners in a cell measuring 27 m²). The cells had good access to natural light, but ventilation was inadequate and prisoners complained that in the summer the cells became very hot. The in-cell sanitary annexes were fully partitioned and had both cold and hot water taps. Some of the cells had been decorated by the inmates themselves and gave a homely impression.", "...", "104.  The section for sentenced working prisoners provided the best conditions of detention in comparison with the other sections. The dormitories were adequately lit, well ventilated and clean. They were suitably furnished (beds, tables and chairs or stools, some shelves and lockers) and inmates could have their own radio or television. Further, the section comprised a sports hall, a spacious “club” where prisoners could watch films and play table tennis, and a chapel.", "105.  The prison did not provide inmates with personal hygiene products other than soap. As mentioned in paragraph 88, access to the shower was limited to once a week.", "As regards food, prisoners were provided with three meals a day. The quantity of the food appeared to be sufficient, but many prisoners complained about its poor quality and lack of variety. In particular, there was no fresh fruit, eggs or milk (not even for juvenile prisoners). To supplement their diet, prisoners relied to a great extent on food parcels from their families and purchases from the prison shop.", "106.  In the light of the above remarks, the CPT recommends that at the Kyiv SIZO:", "- immediate steps be taken to provide every prisoner with a bed;", "- strenuous efforts be made to decrease the overcrowding and to distribute prisoners more evenly amongst the available accommodation, the objective being to offer a minimum of 4 m² of living space per prisoner;", "- measures be taken to ensure, as a matter of priority, access to natural light and adequate ventilation in prisoner accommodation;", "- efforts be made to renovate the prisoner accommodation and ensure an adequate level of hygiene;", "- prisoners be guaranteed access to adequate quantities of essential personal hygiene products and cleaning products for their cells;", "- serious efforts be made to improve the quality and quantity of food provided to prisoners, paying particular attention to the specific dietary needs of juveniles.", "Reference is also made to the recommendation in paragraph 89 as regards access to a shower.", "...", "The SIZO had a library with a collection of some 27,000 books. The delegation was surprised to learn that remand prisoners were not allowed to receive books (other than the Bible) or newspapers from outside. The CPT would like to receive the Ukrainian authorities’ comments concerning this prohibition.", "The only regular out-of-cell activity was outdoor exercise of one hour per day, which took place in a series of exercise yards located on the top of the accommodation blocks. By virtue of their size and configuration, these high-walled, bare areas (measuring between 16 and 60 m²) did not allow prisoners to exercise themselves physically.", "The CPT recommends that the Ukrainian authorities make strenuous efforts to offer organised out-of-cell activities (work, recreation/association, education, sport) to prisoners at the Kyiv SIZO. Further, the Committee recommends that steps be taken to construct more appropriate exercise yards which allow prisoners to exert themselves physically, as well as indoor and outdoor sports facilities.", "...", "6.  Health care", "a.   introduction", "123.  In the course of the 2009 visit, the delegation was informed of a proposal to set up a working group to study the transfer of prisoners’ health care to the Ministry of Health. The CPT can only encourage this initiative, which is consistent with the remarks made in paragraph 142 of the report on its 1998 visit, namely that a greater involvement of the Ministry of Health in the provision of health-care services in prison will help to ensure optimal health care for prisoners, as well as implementation of the general principle of the equivalence of health care with that in the outside community. The Committee wishes to be informed of the action taken on the abovementioned proposal.", "In this context, the CPT also wishes to stress the need for continued professional training for prison health-care staff, with a view to enabling them to perform their duties satisfactorily. The Committee would like to be informed of the national policy in this respect.", "124. The reports on previous visits by the CPT to  contain a number of recommendations, comments and requests for information in the area of provision of health care to prisoners. Despite efforts made by the Ukrainian authorities in recent years and the goodwill and commitment of health-care staff at the penitentiary establishments visited, the provision of health care to inmates remains problematic, due to the shortage of staff, facilities and resources. During the visit, the delegation heard a number of complaints from prisoners at the establishments visited concerning delays in access to a doctor, lack of medication, and the inadequate quality of care.”", "D.  International reports", "1.  2010 Country Report on Human Rights and Practices of the US Department of State released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour in respect of ", "The relevant extract of the report reads as follows:", "“There was a sharp increase in charges brought against opposition politicians after the appointment of a new prosecutor general on November 4, giving rise to the appearance of selective and politically motivated prosecutions by the Yanukovych government. Between November 1 and December 31, prosecutors brought charges against former prime minister Yulyia Tymoshenko and more than eight high-level members of her government for abuse of office and/or misuse of state funds during their tenure. The questioning of accused individuals by government prosecutors, which often lasted for hours at a time over a period of several days, and the denial of bail in certain cases further exacerbated the perception of politically motivated prosecution (see section 4). The government contended that the prosecutions were not targeting the opposition, and that there were many ongoing investigations of members of the governing party; however, with only a few exceptions these were low-level, career officials.”", "2.  Resolution of the European Parliament", "On 9 June 2011 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on : the cases of Yulyia Tymoshenko and other members of the former government.

Furthermore, the fact that the order for the applicant’s detention was not limited in time constitutes constant psychological suffering for her.", "3.  Invoking Article 5 § 1 (b) of the Convention, the applicant alleges that her open-ended detention for alleged obstruction of justice and noncompliance with a lawful order was not based on facts or the national legislation.", "According to the applicant, she was present at all court sessions and arrived on time. Rather, on 5 August 2011 she arrived at the court with a 7minute delay and explained her delay by the fact that she was exhausted by the previous day’s tiring 10-hour court hearing. Moreover, her current address and her permanent address were written in the case-file in accordance with the national law.", "She further states that judge K. did not provide any evidence as to the applicant’s obstructing justice within the meaning of Article 48 of the CCP. This provision defines that term as any action aimed to persuade a witness or a victim to refuse giving testimony or to provide false statement, to persuade an expert not to provide an opinion or to falsify a report, or to delay the investigation of court hearings, not to comply with the procedure during the investigation or in court. According to the applicant, her detention was requested by the GPU after her cross-examining the current Prime Minister who witnessed for the prosecution.", "Lastly, the applicant was arrested like a dangerous criminal by a special police unit which consisted of more than 20 heavily armed men and a special armoured vehicle was waiting for her in the court yard at 8 am, long time before the beginning of the hearing of 5 August 2011.", "4.  Invoking Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, the applicant complains that the first-instance court upheld the decision of detention for unspecified period of time without considering any alternative preventive measures.", "5.  The applicant further complains under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention that she could not effectively challenge the lawfulness of the length of and grounds for her pre-trial detention.
