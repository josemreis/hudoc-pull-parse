He served two periods of detention in a remand centre which he argues was overcrowded and had unhygienic living and sanitary conditions. He claims that smoking was not prohibited in the cell and because of its poor ventilation the asthma condition he suffered was aggravated. In particular, as he was refused medication he had to endure several asthma attacks without any medical assistance. He also complains of the quality of the food and the lack of opportunities for recreation at the centre.

He also alleges that he was denied the right of being visited by his wife and daughter. On this last question he complained to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, which dismissed the complaint. The applicant challenged the refusal in the District court, which in a decision allegedly not sent to the applicant, dismissed the claim. The Court of Appeal also dismissed the applicant’s appeal.", "Admissible under Article 3, Article 8 (concerning the applicant’s right to correspondence with his mother) and Article 13.
