These proceedings were divided into individual sets of proceedings in respect of each of these applicants on 18 August 2005.", "(b)  The first, fifth, thirteenth and sixteenth applicants", "11.  On 22 August 2005 the first, fifth, thirteenth and sixteenth applicants were formally charged under Article 361 § 4 of the CC.", "12.  On the same date the Gegharkunik Regional Court examined the investigator’s motion seeking to have them detained on the grounds that they had committed an offence under Article 361 § 4 of the CC and could abscond. The Regional Court decided to grant this motion, stating that the imputed acts fell into the category of crimes of medium gravity and taking into account their nature and degree of dangerousness. The applicants were present at the respective hearings. These decisions were subject to appeal to the Criminal and Military Court of Appeal within fifteen days.", "13.  On 31 August 2005 the investigator decided to modify the charges against the applicants by bringing a new charge under Article 362 § 1 of the CC on the ground that, pursuant to Section 21 § 2 of the Alternative Service Act, persons performing alternative labour service bore equal liability for the unauthorised abandonment of the place of service to that borne by servicemen performing compulsory military service.", "14.  On 6 and 8 September 2005 the prosecutor approved the indictments under Article 362 § 1 of the CC and the cases were transferred to the  for examination on the merits.", "15.  On 29 November 2005 the fifth, thirteenth and sixteenth applicants filed a motion with the Regional Court, arguing that Article 362 § 1 of the CC was not applicable to their cases, since they were not servicemen, and seeking to have the proceedings terminated.", "16.  On 1 and 2 March 2006 the Regional Court decided to remit the cases for further investigation upon the prosecutor’s motions in order to clarify, inter alia, which norms of criminal law had been breached by the imputed acts and whether the applicants could be considered as subjects of a military crime as defined by Article 356 § 5 of the CC, taking into account that it applied only to servicemen.

They argued that Article 362 § 1 of the CC was not applicable to their cases since they were not servicemen. The acts committed by them were not a criminal offence, since at the material time the CC did not prescribe any penalties for the unauthorised abandonment of the place of alternative labour service. In spite of this, they were charged and detained which violated their right to liberty. The criminal law required that all offences be incorporated into the CC, so the reliance on Section 21 § 2 of the Alternative Service Act had been unlawful.

In particular, he had a permanent place of residence and had not made any attempts to abscond during the first three months of the investigation.

The Explanatory Note to the draft law stated that there were currently up to 29 criminal cases pending before the courts in which charges were brought under Article 361 of the CC.

It points out, however, that the tenth and eleventh applicants were never deprived of their liberty in the course of the criminal proceedings against them (see paragraphs 96-99 above). In such circumstances, they cannot claim to be victims of an alleged violation of Article 5 of the Convention and their relevant complaints under that Article are incompatible ratione personae and must be declared inadmissible.", "118.  The Court will therefore limit its examination of the complaints under Article 5 of the Convention to the remaining seventeen applicants. Hence, its subsequent references to “the applicants” will not include the tenth and eleventh applicants.", "119.  The Court further considers it possible to examine the complaints of all seventeen applicants jointly in view of their factual similarity and the identical nature of their allegations.", "II.  PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS", "A.  The Government’s objection related to the third, fourth and eighteenth applicants", "120.  The Government claimed that the third, fourth and eighteenth applicants had not been subjected to detention. The only preventive measure imposed on them was the written undertaking not to leave their places of residence.", "121.  The Court notes that indeed the third, fourth and eighteenth applicants were not detained prior to their conviction. However, after their sentences were overturned by the Court of Appeal on 28 February and 6 March 2006 they remained in pre-trial detention (see Solmaz v. , no. 27561/02, § 34, 16 January 2007), until their release on 7 April 2006 (see paragraphs 87, 89 and 93 above). Thus, they can claim to be victims of an alleged violation of Article 5 §§ 1 (c) and 3 of the Convention in respect of those periods.", "122.  The Government’s objection must therefore be dismissed.", "B.  The Government’s objection as to non-exhaustion", "123.  The Government submitted that the applicants had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies, because they had not lodged appeals against the first instance courts’ decisions imposing detention. Furthermore, they had not raised any arguments or objections when the question of their placement in detention was examined at the first detention hearings in the first instance courts.", "124.  The applicants submitted that they had filed numerous appeals and motions seeking a termination of the criminal proceedings and to be released. Any appeal against detention was futile as it would certainly be dismissed, as demonstrated by the systematic dismissal of numerous motions and appeals requesting release, until it became apparent to the General Prosecutor’s Office that the charges lacked corpus delicti. Thus, the Armenian courts at the material time were not inclined to grant any remedy against the illegal actions of the prosecutors who prosecuted in the absence of corpus delicti. No matter how many appeals they filed, the domestic courts were not willing to rule against the General Prosecutor’s Office.", "125.  The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring a case against the State before an international judicial body to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system, thus dispensing States from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems. In order to comply with the rule, normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria no. 24760/94, § 85, ECHR 1999-VIII).", "126.  Furthermore, under Article 35 the existence of remedies which are available and sufficient must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among other authorities, De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, 22 May 1984, § 39, Series A no. 77, and Vernillo v. France, 20 February 1991, § 27, Series A no. 198). It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant’s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV).", "127.  Once this burden of proof has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement (see Kalashnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 47095/99, 18 September 2001, and Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, § 67, 28 March 2006).", "128.  The Court further emphasises that Article 35 § 1 of the Convention must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Sejdovic v.  [GC], no. 56581/00, § 44, ECHR 2006II). Moreover, the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically. In reviewing whether the rule has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the State concerned, the general legal and political context in which they operate, as well as the particular circumstances of the case and whether the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected in order to exhaust available domestic remedies (see Salman v.  [GC], no. 21986/93, § 86, ECHR 2000VII, and Melnik, cited above, § 67).", "129.  Turning to the circumstances of the present case, it indeed appears that the applicants did not lodge appeals against the decisions of the first instance courts imposing detention or raise during those first detention hearings their allegation that the acts of which they were accused were not an offence under the domestic law and that therefore their detention was not based on a reasonable suspicion of their having committed an offence. However, almost all of the applicants raised this issue in substance in one way or another at a later stage, either as separate motions filed with the first instance courts or the Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 15, 26, 41, 52, 86 and 90 above) or in their appeals against the decisions remitting their cases for further investigation (see paragraphs 18, 33, 45, 54, 63 and 75 above) or in their appeals against their convictions (see paragraphs 28, 43 and 85 above). In all of those cases, both the first instance and appeal courts either failed to address this issue or at most expressed doubts and refrained from making any conclusive findings, adding that this issue was to be clarified during further investigation and refusing to release the applicants (see paragraphs 29, 31, 44, 74, 89 and 91 above). Even in those few cases in which the applicants were released, this was always done on a ground unrelated to the existence of a reasonable suspicion of their having committed an offence, namely on the ground that there were no risks that the applicants would abscond, obstruct the investigation or commit another offence (see paragraphs 20, 21, 35 and 53 above).", "130.  In the light of the above, the Court has serious doubts that there were any reasonable prospects of success had the applicants raised this issue in their earlier appeals or during the first detention hearings before the first instance courts. Furthermore, judging by the overall manner in which the domestic courts approached the applicants’ allegation of the lack of a reasonable suspicion, it appears that the judicial practice at the material time was not to address this question in any conclusive manner, until legislative changes were introduced and the prosecution dropped the charges. The Court therefore concludes that the remedies pointed out by the Government were not effective or capable of providing redress in respect of the applicants’ complaint in question and did not offer reasonable prospects of success in the particular circumstances of the case. The Government’s objection as to non-exhaustion must be therefore dismissed.", "III.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 § 1 (c) OF THE CONVENTION", "131.  The applicants complained that they had been detained for an act which did not constitute an offence at the material time. They invoked Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "“1.  Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:", "...", "(c)  the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;”", "A.  Admissibility", "132.  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The parties’ submissions", "133.  The applicants submitted that their detention had not been based on a reasonable suspicion of their having committed an offence. The law at the material time did not prescribe an offence for unauthorised abandonment of the place of alternative service, which was also confirmed by the General Prosecutor who found that their actions lacked corpus delicti. Thus, their detention was in violation of Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention.", "134.  The Government submitted that Article 5 of the Convention required compliance with domestic law. The applicants had breached the law by wilfully abandoning the places of their service. Since they were subject to all the obligations prescribed by the Constitution, the investigating authority, based on a reasonable suspicion that they had committed acts prohibited by law, filed motions for detention. Furthermore, the investigating authority applied Section 21 § 2 of the Alternative Service Act which was in force at the material time. Accordingly, the investigating authority and the District Courts had issued lawful decisions and detained the applicants for having committed an act prohibited by law. Hence, the applicants’ detention was lawful. They had been charged for their actions under Articles 361 and 362 of the CC. Following an examination of the applicants’ cases on the merits and after additional investigation, the domestic authorities found out that the acts committed by the applicants lacked corpus delicti, the prosecutor terminated the proceedings and released the applicants. According to the Court’s case-law, detention was in principle lawful if carried out pursuant to a court order. A court error under domestic law in making the order would not necessarily retrospectively affect the validity of the intervening period of detention. In conclusion, there was no violation of Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "135.  The Court reiterates that Article 5 § 1 of the Convention contains an exhaustive list of permissible grounds for deprivation of liberty which must be interpreted strictly and no deprivation of liberty will be lawful unless it falls within one of those grounds (see, among other authorities, Ciulla v. , 22 February 1989, § 41, Series A no. 148, and Saadi v. the  [GC], no. 13229/03, § 43, ECHR 2008).", "136.  A person may be detained under Article 5 § 1 (c) only in the context of criminal proceedings, for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on suspicion of his having committed an offence (see Jėčius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, § 50, ECHR 2000-IX, and Włoch v. Poland, no. 27785/95, § 108, ECHR 2000XI). Apart from its factual side, which is most often in issue, the existence of such suspicion additionally requires that the facts relied on can be reasonably considered as behaviour criminalised under domestic law. Thus, there could clearly not be a “reasonable suspicion” if the acts held against a detained person did not constitute an offence at the time when they were committed (see Kandzhov v. , no. 68294/01, § 57, 6 November 2008).", "137.  The Court must therefore examine whether the applicants’ arrest and detention were “lawful” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 and whether their deprivation of liberty was based on a reasonable suspicion of their having committed an “offence”.", "138.  The applicants are Jehovah’s Witnesses who were performing alternative civilian service but chose to abandon their service without authorisation, alleging that it was not of a truly civilian nature. They were subsequently charged under Articles 361 and 362 of the CC which prescribed penalties for desertion and unauthorised abandonment of the military unit. Most of the applicants were placed in pre-trial detention, while others were deprived of their liberty following their convictions and stayed in detention after their convictions were overturned.", "139.  The Court notes that at the time when the applicants committed the above acts, Armenian law did not prescribe an offence for unauthorised abandonment of a place where one performed alternative service and such offence was incorporated in the CC only on 1 June 2006 with effect from 1 July 2006, that is following the circumstances of the present case. This was in fact established on the domestic level, namely acknowledged by the General Prosecutor, who, following the remittals of the applicants’ cases by the domestic courts for an additional investigation, decided to terminate the proceedings against the applicants on this ground (see paragraph 101 above). Articles 361 and 362 of the CC were applicable only to servicemen and were wrongly applied to the applicants (see also paragraphs 110-113 above). It follows that the acts of which the applicants were accused and which provided the basis for their detention did not constitute an offence under the domestic law at the material time. The Court therefore concludes that the applicants’ deprivation of liberty was not based on a reasonable suspicion of their having committed an “offence” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention. The fact that the criminal proceedings against the applicants had been terminated and they were released from detention is not sufficient reason for finding that the applicants could not claim to be victims of a violation of Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention. No compensation for unlawful detention had been awarded to them at the domestic level, and furthermore, the Government, in their observations, did not acknowledge that the applicants had been unlawfully deprived of their liberty.", "140.  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention.", "IV.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 § 3 OF THE CONVENTION", "141.  The seventeenth applicant complained that he had not been brought before a judge following his arrest. The applicants also complained that the domestic courts had failed to provide reasons for their continued detention. They invoked Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "“3.  Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.”", "A.  Admissibility", "1.  The alleged non-appearance of the seventeenth applicant before a judge", "142.  The Government submitted that the seventeenth applicant was promptly brought before a judge following his arrest. In particular, he was arrested on 24 August 2005 at 6 p.m. and brought before a judge on 26 August 2005 at 4 p.m. Thus, he was brought before a judge in about 46 hours which was compatible with the requirements of Article 5 § 3.", "143.  The applicant submitted that he was not brought promptly before a judicial officer. The period of 46 hours was excessive in the particular circumstances of the case. Besides, the judge who examined the question of placing him in detention lacked the requisite independence to be regarded as a judicial officer within the meaning of Article 5 § 3 because he failed to provide proper reasons for his detention.", "144.  The Court observes that Article 5 § 3 requires that an arrested individual be brought promptly before a judge or judicial officer, to allow detection of any ill-treatment and to keep to a minimum any unjustified interference with individual liberty (see Kandzhov v. Bulgaria, no. 68294/01, § 65, 6 November 2008). While promptness has to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see Aquilina v.  [GC], no. 25642/94, § 48, ECHR 1999III), the scope for flexibility in interpreting and applying the notion of “promptness” is very limited (see Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, 29 November 1988, § 62, Series A no. 145B). Furthermore, the judicial officer must offer the requisite guarantees of independence from the executive and the parties (see McKay v. the  [GC], no. 543/03, § 35, ECHR 2006X).", "145.  In the present case, the seventeenth applicant was brought before a judge less than two days after his arrest, namely in about 46 hours (see paragraphs 65 and 67 above). The Court is of the opinion that this period could be regarded as “prompt” for the purposes of Article 5 § 3. Furthermore, the applicant has failed to submit any evidence or convincing arguments in support of his allegation that the judge of the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan, who examined the question of placing him in pre-trial detention, lacked the requisite independence. The Court therefore concludes that there is nothing in the materials before it to suggest that the seventeenth applicant’s appearance before a judge following his arrest was incompatible with the requirements of Article 5 § 3.", "146.  It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.", "2.  The alleged failure to provide reasons", "147.  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "148.  The applicants submitted that the domestic courts had failed to provide reasons for their continued detention. They posed no threats warranting detention and were charged in the absence of corpus delicti. All the detention decisions lacked legal basis. There was no reasonable and sufficient justification for detaining them.", "149.  The Government submitted that the domestic courts had provided reasons as required by Article 135 of the CCP. In particular, there were sufficient grounds to believe that the applicants might abscond, obstruct justice, avoid responsibility and the imposed punishment, and oppose the execution of the verdict. They also took into account the nature and the degree of dangerousness of the imputed acts. The courts adopted reasoned decisions since the applicants could have prejudiced the administration of justice, committed further offences, caused public disorder, as well as served as a bad example for other servicemen and other persons performing alternative service.", "150.  The Court notes that this complaint concerns the same period of detention which it has found was not based on a reasonable suspicion in violation of Article 5 § 1 (c). It therefore does not consider it necessary to rule on this complaint separately.", "V.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 § 5 OF THE CONVENTION", "151.  The applicants complained that they were denied compensation for non-pecuniary damage for a violation of their rights under Article 5 of the Convention. They invoked Article 5 § 5 of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "“5.  Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation.”", "A.  Admissibility", "152.  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The parties’ submissions", "153.  The applicants submitted that the domestic law did not provide for an enforceable right to compensation of a non-pecuniary nature in violation of Article 5 § 5 of the Convention.", "154.  The Government submitted that the fact that no non-pecuniary damage in the form of monetary compensation was available to the applicants did not deprive them of compensation. Thus, the General Prosecutor apologised to them in an official letter, which should also be considered as compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by them.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "155.  The Court reiterates that Article 5 § 5 is complied with where it is possible to apply for compensation in respect of a deprivation of liberty effected in conditions contrary to paragraphs 1, 2, 3 or 4. The right to compensation set forth in paragraph 5 therefore presupposes that a violation of one of the other paragraphs has been established, either by a domestic authority or by the Convention institutions (see, among other authorities, N.C. v.  [GC], no. 24952/94, § 49, ECHR 2002X).", "156.  In the present case, the Court found a violation of Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention. Consequently, Article 5 § 5 is applicable to the applicants’ case.", "157.  The Court notes that it has previously found unavailability of compensation of a non-pecuniary nature for distress, anxiety and frustration which may result from violations of the guarantees of Article 5 to be in violation of paragraph 5 of that Article (see Pavletić v. Slovakia, no. 39359/98, § 96, 22 June 2004). Indeed, Article 5 § 5 should not be construed as affording a right to compensation of purely pecuniary nature, but should also afford such right for any distress, anxiety and frustration that a person may suffer as a result of a violation of other provisions of Article 5.", "158.  The Court observes that the Armenian law at the material time did not provide a right to claim compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered, including as a result of a breach of any of the first four paragraphs of Article 5 of the Convention. In particular, Article 66 of the CCP afforded an acquitted person with a possibility to claim compensation only for pecuniary damage. Similarly, while Article 1064 of the Civil Code provided for a possibility to claim compensation as a result of unlawful detention, Article 17 of the Civil Code limited such compensation only to pecuniary damage, such as any expenses borne or lost income. It follows that the applicants did not enjoy in law or in practice an enforceable right to compensation within the meaning of Article 5 § 5.", "159.  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 5 § 5 of the Convention.", "VI.  OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION", "160.  The applicants lastly raised a number of other complaints under Article 5 §§ 3 and 5, Article 6 §§ 1 and 2, and Articles 9, 13 and 14 of the Convention.", "161.  Having regard to all the material in its possession, and in so far as these complaints fall within its competence, the Court finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.", "VII.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "162.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "163.  The applicants claimed the following amounts in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage respectively:", "(a)  the first applicant: 1,085 euros (EUR) and EUR 21,000;", "(b)  the second applicant: EUR 1,085 and EUR 22,000;", "(c)  the third applicant: EUR 872 and EUR 14,000;", "(d)  the fourth applicant: EUR 530 and EUR 13,500;", "(e)  the fifth applicant: EUR 1,698 and EUR 21,000;", "(f)  the sixth applicant: EUR 669 and EUR 22,000;", "(g)  the seventh applicant: EUR 1,798 and EUR 22,000;", "(h)  the eighth applicant: EUR 1,141 and EUR 22,000;", "(i)  the ninth applicant: EUR 1,557 and EUR 22,000;", "(j)  the twelfth applicant: EUR 1,559 and EUR 18,000;", "(k)  the thirteenth applicant: EUR 591 and EUR 21,000;", "(l)  the fourteenth applicant: EUR 849 and EUR 13,500;", "(m)  the fifteenth applicant: EUR 637 and EUR 13,000;", "(n)  the sixteenth applicant: EUR 1,898 and EUR 21,000;", "(o)  the seventeenth applicant: EUR 980 and EUR 21,000;", "(p)  the eighteenth applicant: EUR 1,183 and EUR 14,000;", "(q)  the nineteenth applicant: EUR 943 and EUR 21,000.", "The pecuniary damages claimed included the alleged travel, food and medical treatment expenses which they and their relatives had incurred as a result of their unlawful detention, as well as the alleged lost income.", "164.  The Government submitted that the applicants had been provided with food and, if necessary, any medical treatment while in detention at the expense of the State. Hence, any alleged extra expenses could not be considered necessary. In any case, the applicants had failed to support their claims with any documentary evidence. Furthermore, their claim for lost income was hypothetical. The Government lastly objected to their claims for non-pecuniary damage.", "165.  The Court notes that the applicants’ claims for pecuniary damage are not supported by any evidence. It therefore rejects these claims. On the other hand, it considers that the applicants must have undoubtedly suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of the violations found and decides to award each of the applicants EUR 6,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "166.  The applicants also claimed EUR 38,000 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and EUR 10,850 for those incurred before the Court.", "167.  The Government submitted that the applicants’ claims for costs and expenses were not duly documented and they had failed to demonstrate that those costs had been actually incurred. The invoices submitted by the applicants could not be regarded as proof of payment or an agreement between them and their lawyers to make such payments in the future. Furthermore, the lawyers’ fees were inflated, exorbitant and unreasonable. Lastly, part of the lawyers’ work concerned complaints which were inadmissible.", "168.  According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. Furthermore, legal costs are only recoverable in so far as they relate to the violation found (see Beyeler v. Italy (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 33202/96, § 27, 28 May 2002). In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award to the applicants jointly the sum of EUR 10,000 covering costs under all heads.", "C.  Default interest", "169.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Decides to dismiss the Government’s objections as to the victim status of third, fourth and eighteenth applicants, and as to non-exhaustion;", "", "2.  Declares the complaints of all the applicants, except the tenth and eleventh applicants, concerning the lack of a reasonable suspicion of their having committed an offence, the alleged lack of relevant and sufficient reasons for their continued detention and the lack of an enforceable right to compensation of a non-pecuniary nature admissible under Article 5 §§ 1 (c), 3 and 5 of the Convention and the remainder of the application inadmissible;", "", "3.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention;", "", "4.  Holds that there is no need to examine the complaint under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention;", "", "5.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 5 of the Convention;", "", "6.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:", "(i)  EUR 6,000 (six thousand euros) to each of the applicants, plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;", "(ii)  EUR 10,000 (ten thousand euros) to the applicants jointly, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants, in respect of costs and expenses;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "7.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicants’ claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 27 November 2012, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\t Quesada\tJosep Casadevall\n\tRegistrar\tPresident"]}
