She maintained that there was a lacuna in the law that had to be filled by reference to the principles of equality and non-discrimination and that the refusal to update information inscribed on the register of births constituted an undue interference with both the private and family lives of the persons concerned.", "On 26 February 2008 the first-instance court dismissed the case. It held that contrary to adoptions by spouses, where a child was adopted by a single person, it was not possible to draw an analogy between biological parents and the adoptive parent as there was either no father or mother.", "On 5 November 2009 after having held a hearing the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the first-instance court.", "In a letter dated 25 January 2012 the applicant’s representative informed the Registry that subsequent to an amendment to the directive concerned, the applicant had applied to the Civil Registry Office once again and that her request had finally been admitted in 2011.

She points out that the interference lacked a legal basis and did not pursue any legitimate aim. In this connection she submits that since her name was not indicated on her son’s identity card and certificate of birth, in enrolling him in the school or when travelling with him, she was obliged to reveal that she had adopted him and to provide, each and every time, all the relevant court decisions in evidence.", "The applicant further complains under Article 14 of the Convention that she, together with her son, was discriminated against on the basis of civil status since adoptive spouses were entitled to have their names recorded on the adopted child’s birth records, thus identity card.", "She also relies on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.", "", "QUESTIONS", "", "", "1.  Was there an interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her private and family life within the meaning of Article 8 § 1 of the Convention on account of the authorities’ refusal to record her as the mother of her child in the civil registers until 2011?", "", "If so, was that interference in accordance with the law and necessary in terms of Article 8 § 2 ?", "", "2.  Which changes, if any, have been made in the applicable laws and/or regulations to remedy the situation of the single adoptive mothers and/or fathers ?", "", ""]}
