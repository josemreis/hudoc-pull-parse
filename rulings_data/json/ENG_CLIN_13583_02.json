The applicant’s request for the judge to be withdrawn was dismissed. The appeal court found that the investigating judge had delivered an objective report on a difficult investigation and that the impugned remarks had been of minimal importance. The applicant was committed for trial before an assize court. The indictment was released to the press by a prosecution service spokesperson, as permitted by the law (the case was the subject of intense media interest), and was served on the applicant the same day, a few weeks ahead of the commencement of the proceedings before the assize court. The applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment for, among other offences, the murder of his two wives and four of his children and the rape and indecent assault of several of his daughters.", "Admissible under Article 6 § 1 and § 2 as to the impugned remarks of the investigating judge.", "Inadmissible under Article 6 with respect to the release of the indictment to the press.

The communication had been aimed solely at informing the public, via the press, of the subject of the forthcoming assize proceedings in a case which had attracted intense media interest: manifestly ill-founded.", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the ", ""]}
