The court further noted that the perpetuators were given lenient sentences due to the significant passage of time from the committal of the crime. It further noted that the perpetuators had not shown any genuine regret as regards the acts committed against the applicant who, on the other hand, continued to suffer from the consequences thereof.

She submitted that her interest in criminal proceedings had not only been of pecuniary nature but also aimed at safeguarding her rights under Article 3 of the Convention.
