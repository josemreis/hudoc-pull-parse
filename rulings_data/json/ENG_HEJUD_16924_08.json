He relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal ...”", "41.  The Government contested that argument.", "A.  Admissibility", "42.  The Government disputed the admissibility of this complaint on two grounds. They argued that Article 6 was inapplicable and that, in any event, the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies.", "1.  Applicability", "(a)  The arguments of the parties", "43.  The Government first referred to the Court’s case-law, according to which the right of access to court extended only to “contestations” (disputes) over (civil) “rights and obligations” which were, at least on arguable grounds, recognised under domestic law (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, § 81, Series A no. 98). When it was clear that that right did not exist in the domestic legal system, Article 6 was not applicable, and the Court, when interpreting that Article, could not create a right which had no foundation in the domestic legal system.", "44.  In that connection the Government first submitted that in Croatian law there was no substantive (civil) right to employment or appointment to the civil service. In particular, they explained that in order to acquire the right to be appointed to the position of deputy county state attorney it was not sufficient for a candidate to meet the formal statutory requirements set forth in sections 62(2) and 63(2) of the State Attorneys Act (see paragraph 19 above). It was also necessary that a candidate had the required expertise and independence, as provided in section 62(1) of the State Attorneys Act (see paragraph 19 above), and received a sufficient number of votes from the members of the State Attorneys Council. Therefore, even if all candidates met the formal statutory requirements, the post of deputy county state attorney could remain vacant if none of them received the required number of votes. In assessing the expertise and independence of the candidates in the present case, after holding a secret ballot the State Attorneys Council appointed Mrs D.K.I., and not the applicant, deputy county state attorney in the Vukovar County State Attorney’s Office. It followed that the applicant had not had the right to be appointed to that post.", "45.  The Government further argued that, even if the  had quashed the impugned decision of the State Attorneys Council, the applicant would not have been appointed instead of Mrs D.K.I.; rather, the position would have remained vacant. A new advertisement would have been published and a new selection procedure conducted. That fact was a strong indication that: (a) as already stated above, the applicant had not had the right to be appointed to the post of deputy county state attorney in the Vukovar County State Attorney’s Office (see, mutatis mutandis, Sultana v. Malta (dec.), no. 970/04, 11 December 2007), and (b) even if he had had that right, the proceedings in question had not been directly decisive for his “rights and obligations” (see, mutatis mutandis, Revel and Mora v. France (dec.), no. 171/03, 15 November 2005).", "46.  Lastly, the Government submitted that in Croatian law there was no right to challenge an appointment to the civil service either. In particular, decisions of the State Attorneys Council on appointments could only be reviewed, under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act, if they were not in accordance with constitutionally guaranteed rights or freedoms (see paragraph 21 above). However, in the Sultana case, the Court had already held that the right to lodge a similar remedy had no features of private law and thus had no elements which could make it akin to a “civil” right, which would be required to make Article 6 applicable (see Sultana, cited above).", "47.  Having regard to the above, the Government considered that Article 6 was not applicable in the present case.", "48.  The applicant argued that the domestic courts failed to protect his right to access to public service. In his view, that right was a “civil right” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "(b)  The Court’s assessment", "49.  The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. The right of access, namely the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect of this “right to a court” (see, notably, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, §§ 28-36, Series A no. 18). This right extends only to “civil rights and obligations” which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law (see James and Others, loc. cit.). Therefore, in order to establish whether the civil head of Article 6 is applicable in the present case, and, consequently, whether the applicant could rely on the right of access to court, the Court should first examine whether he had a “right” which could arguably be said to be recognised under Croatian law, and secondly, whether that right was a “civil” one.", "(i)  Existence of a right", "50.  The Court notes in this connection that according to the Administrative Court’s case-law, every candidate satisfying the statutory requirements has the right to equal participation in a competition for a public office, which right is a corollary of the right to equal access to public service guaranteed by Article 44 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above). Having regard to the findings of the State Attorneys Council in the present case, according to which both the applicant and Mrs D.K.I. satisfied the statutory conditions for appointment to the post of deputy county state attorney in the Vukovar County State Attorney’s Office (see paragraph 7 above), the Court considers that the applicant had a “right” which could arguably be said to be recognised under Croatian law (see, for example, Kübler v. , no. 32715/06, § 46, 13 January 2011; Lombardi Vallauri v. , no. 39128/05, § 62, ECHR 2009... (extracts); and Fiume v. Italy, no. 20774/05, § 35, 30 June 2009).", " (ii)  Civil nature of the right", "51.  As regards the “civil” nature of the right, the Court held that the approach developed in the case of Vilho Eskelinen and Others v.  ([GC], no. 63235/00, ECHR 2007IV, see paragraph 53 below) also applied to the right of access to a public office (see, notably, Kübler, cited above, § 45; and, implicitly, Josephides v. , no. 33761/02, § 54, 6 December 2007; Lombardi Vallauri, cited above, loc. cit.; and Penttinen v. Finland (dec.), no. 9125/07, 5 January 2010).", "52.  Before the judgment in the Vilho Eskelinen case, the Court held that employment disputes between the authorities and public servants whose duties typified the specific activities of public service, in so far as the latter was acting as the depositary of public authority responsible for protecting the general interests of the State, were not “civil” and were excluded from the scope of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Pellegrin v. France [GC], no. 28541/95, § 66, ECHR 1999VIII). Likewise, employment disputes involving state attorneys (solicitors general) were also excluded from the scope of Article 6 § 1 (see Mickovski v. the  (dec.), no. 68329/01, 10 November 2005).", "53.  In the Vilho Eskelinen case the Court revisited the applicability of Article 6 § 1 and held that it was for the Contracting States, in particular the competent national legislature, and not the Court, to identify expressly those areas of public service involving the exercise of the discretionary powers intrinsic to State sovereignty where the interests of the individual must give way. If a domestic system barred access to court, the Court would verify that the dispute was indeed such as to justify the application of the exception to the guarantees of Article 6. If it did not, then there was no issue and Article 6 § 1 would apply (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, § 61).", "54.  Following the Vilho Eskelinen case, the Court found Article 6 to be inapplicable to proceedings concerning recruitment (see Apay v. Turkey, no. 3964/05, 11 December 2007) and (disciplinary) proceedings concerning the termination of employment of public prosecutors (see Nazsiz v. Turkey, no. 22412/05 26 May 2009) but only because the domestic law expressly excluded access to court. However, turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court first notes that section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act provides for “a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right”, a judicial remedy open to anyone who considers that his or her rights or freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution have been violated by a decision of a public authority in a situation where no other judicial remedy is available (see paragraph 34 above). It further notes that in the present case the applicant was entitled to contest the impugned decision of the State Attorneys Council of 11 January 2005 before the Administrative Court by lodging such a request in so far as that decision was contrary to his constitutional right to equal access to the public service (see paragraphs 9, 14, 16 and 21 above).", " (iii)  Conclusion", "55.  In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that Article 6 of the Convention under its civil head is applicable to the present case (see, mutatis mutandis, Josephides, cited above, § 55; Penttinen, cited above; Kravchenko and Others (military housing) v. Russia, nos. 11609/05, 12516/05, 17393/05, 20214/05, 25724/05, 32953/05, 1953/06, 10908/06, 16101/06, 26696/06, 40417/06, 44437/06, 44977/06, 46544/06, 50835/06, 22635/07, 36662/07, 36951/07, 38501/07, 54307/07, 22723/08, 36406/08 and 55990/08, § 23, 16 September 2010; and Kübler, cited above, § 46) and, consequently, that the applicant should have had access to court in respect of his right to equal access to public service guaranteed by Article 44 of the Constitution.", "56.  It follows that the Government’s objection to the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention must be dismissed.", "2.  Non-exhaustion of domestic remedies", "(a)  The arguments of the parties", "57.  The Government further argued that, after the  declared his administrative action inadmissible on 16 March 2005, the applicant should have lodged a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act. According to the Government, that followed from the Administrative Court’s decision of 16 March 2005. That would have enabled the Administrative Court to decide on the merits of the applicant’s request regardless of the fact that it would have been submitted outside of the statutory time-limit, and having regard to the Constitutional Court’s jurisprudence, according to which a party which followed an incorrect information on legal remedies should not suffer any adverse consequences as a result. Even if the  had declared such a request inadmissible as lodged out of time, the applicant could have lodged a constitutional complaint against such a decision relying on the above-mentioned jurisprudence of the .", "58.  In addition, the Government submitted that in his administrative action of 4 February 2005 the applicant had not relied on any of the constitutionally guaranteed rights, in particular the right to equal access to public service guaranteed by Article 44 of the Constitution. Had he done so, the  would not have declared his action inadmissible but it would have treated it as a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right and examined it on its merits. However, since he had not done so, his action could not, either in form or in substance, be viewed as a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right within the meaning of section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act, and therefore had to be declared inadmissible.", "59.  The applicant did not comment on this issue.", "(b)  The Court’s assessment", "60.  The Court first notes that there is nothing in the text of the Administrative Court’s decision of 16 March 2005 that would indicate, as suggested by the Government (see paragraph 57 above), that the applicant should have re-submitted his action brought under section 23 of the Administrative Disputes Act as a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right under section 66 of the same Act (see paragraph 9 above). Had he done so, his request would have been declared inadmissible for failure to comply with the statutory time-limit of thirty days. The Court further notes that the  dismissed the applicant’s subsequent constitutional complaint lodged against the Administrative Court’s decision (see paragraph 11 above). This suggests that the  considered the contested decision not to be contrary to its jurisprudence, according to which a party which followed an incorrect information on legal remedies should not suffer any adverse consequences as a result. Moreover, that jurisprudence was developed in respect of cases where the first-instance courts wrongly informed parties by indicating longer time-limits for lodging appeals against their decisions than those provided in the relevant legislation. In such cases the  held that their appeals could not be declared inadmissible as lodged out of time if they had been lodged within the time-limits indicated by the first-instance courts (see paragraph 13 above). However, the present case concerns a situation where the applicant was informed to use a different remedy from the one actually available under the relevant legislation, and the Court is unaware of any decision of the Constitutional Court that would sanction such erroneous information on legal remedies.", "61.  Furthermore, the Court is not convinced by the Government’s argument that in his administrative action the applicant should have relied on a constitutionally guaranteed right, such as, for example, the right to equal access to public service guaranteed by Article 44 of the Constitution, in which case the Administrative Court would have decided on the merits of his action, treating it, in substance, as a request under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act. In this connection the Court notes that while the case-law of the Administrative Court requires claimants to specify in their requests lodged under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act the constitutional right which has allegedly been violated by the contested decision (see paragraph 36 above), the same or similar requirement (see paragraph 28 above) does not exist in respect of administrative actions instituting administrative dispute proceedings brought under section 23 of the same Act, to which the applicant resorted to. Given that in the present case the State Attorneys Council had informed the applicant to bring such an action against its decision of 11 January 2005, instead of informing him to lodge a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right, the Court considers that he was not obliged to comply with the above-mentioned requirement.", "62.  It follows, in the light of the foregoing, that the Government’s objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies must also be dismissed.", "63.  The Court further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The arguments of the parties", "64.  The Government maintained that the applicant’s right of access to court had not been violated. In so doing they relied on the same arguments summarised in paragraph 58 above.", "65.  The applicant maintained his view that by declaring his action inadmissible, despite the fact that the State Attorneys Council had wrongly informed him to resort to that remedy, the Administrative Court had violated his right of access to court.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "66.  The Court reiterates that the right of access to court is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations. These are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State. In this respect, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, although the final decision as to the observance of the Convention’s requirements rests with the Court. However, these limitations must not restrict or reduce the access left to an individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired (see, for example, Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, § 57, Series A no. 93).", "67.  Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that the State Attorneys Council had wrongly informed the applicant on the legal remedies available against its decision of 11 January 2005. In particular, it informed him that administrative dispute proceedings could be instituted by bringing an action in the Administrative Court under section 23 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 7 above), whereas the (only) available remedy was in fact a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right under section 66 of the same Act (see paragraphs 9 and 21 above). When the applicant eventually brought the action as informed, the  declared it inadmissible and refused to review the contested decision on the merits. It did so because: (a) the contested decision did not constitute an administrative act within the meaning of section of 6(2) the Administrative Disputes Act, and (b) in his action the applicant had not relied on any right or freedom guaranteed by the Constitution and thereby prevented the Administrative Court from viewing his action, in substance, as a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 9 above).", "68.  The Court reiterates that it is in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret and apply the domestic law. This applies in particular to the interpretation by courts of rules of a procedural nature. The Court’s role is confined to ascertaining whether the effects of such an interpretation are compatible with the Convention (see, for example, Tejedor García v. Spain, 16 December 1997, § 31, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997VIII, and Pérez de Rada Cavanilles v. Spain, 28 October 1998, § 43, Reports 1998VIII).", "69.   In order to satisfy itself that the very essence of the applicant’s right of access to court was not impaired, the Court must examine whether the Administrative Court’s decision to declare his action inadmissible could be regarded as foreseeable having regard to the relevant legislation and the case-law and given the fact that the applicant was wrongly informed on legal remedies (see, mutatis mutandis, Levages Prestations Services v. France, 23 October 1996, § 42, Reports 1996V, and Osu v. Italy, no. 36534/97, § 35, 11 July 2002).", "70.  In this connection the Court first notes that the State Attorneys Act had no provisions on remedies available against decisions of the State Attorneys Council on appointment of deputy state attorneys (see paragraph 20 above), and that therefore from its text it was not certain what the right remedy to be used was. This uncertainty was remedied by judicial interpretation on 17 November 2004 when the  held for the first time that such decisions could only be challenged by a request for the protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right under section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 21 above). While it is true that the above-mentioned decision of the Administrative Court was rendered some two months before the applicant brought his action in the same court, the Court does not consider that the applicant should have been aware of it and disregarded the explicit information on legal remedies contained in the decision of the State Attorneys Council he was contesting. This is so because in cases like the present one, where the remedy in question was the result of interpretation by the courts, it normally takes six months for such a development of the case-law to acquire a sufficient degree of legal certainty before the public may be considered to be effectively aware of the domestic decision which had established the remedy and the persons concerned be enabled and obliged to use it (see, mutatis mutandis, Depauw v. Belgium (dec.), no. 2115/04, ECHR 2007V (extracts), and Provide S.r.l. v. Italy, no. 62155/00, § 18, ECHR 2007VIII (extracts).", "71.  In these particular circumstances the applicant might have reasonably expected, having regard to section 29(1) and (2) in conjunction with section 66 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraphs 29-30 and 34 above), from the Administrative Court to first inform him that his action could only be examined as a request for a protection of a constitutionally guaranteed right, and to invite him to specify which constitutional right he considered to have been violated. Instead, the  declared his action inadmissible outright. As a result, the applicant found himself in a situation, where he was prevented, through no fault of his own, from having the impugned decision of the State Attorneys Council examined on its merits (see, mutatis mutandis, Société Anonyme Sotiris and Nikos Koutras Attee v. , no. 39442/98, §§ 21-23, ECHR 2000XII; and Platakou v. Greece, no. 38460/97, §§ 39 and 49, ECHR 2001I). In the Court’s view, that situation impaired the very essence of the applicant’s right of access to court as secured by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "72.  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the present case.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXCESSIVE LENGTH OF THE PROCEEDINGS", "73.  The applicant also complained that the length of the above proceedings had been incompatible with the “reasonable time” requirement laid down in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "74.  The Court notes that the proceedings complained of lasted some three years and three months, during which period the case was examined at three levels of jurisdiction. That being so, the Court considers, in the light of the criteria established in its case-law on the question of “reasonable time” (the complexity of the case, the applicant’s conduct and that of the competent authorities), and having regard to all the information in its possession, that such a period cannot be considered excessive. Consequently, the length of the proceedings in the present case was not unreasonable.", "75.  It follows that this complaint is inadmissible under Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention as manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4 thereof.", "III.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "76.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "77.  The applicant claimed 243,896.37 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage sustained on account of loss of earnings. He also claimed EUR 60,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "78.  The Government contested these claims.", "79.  The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim.", "80.  On the other hand, the Court finds that the applicant must have sustained non-pecuniary damage. In this connection the Court first reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress in cases where it finds that an applicant has not had access to court in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention would, as a rule, be to reopen the proceedings in due course and reexamine the case in keeping with all the requirements of a fair hearing (see, for example, Lungoci v. Romania, no. 62710/00, § 56, 26 January 2006; Yanakiev v. Bulgaria, no. 40476/98, § 90, 10 August 2006; and Lesjak v. , no. 25904/06, § 54, 18 February 2010). In this connection the Court notes that, having regard to section 60 of the Administrative Disputes Act (see paragraph 33 above), the applicant can now, relying on sections 25-59 of the same Act (see paragraph 32 above) in conjunction with section 428a of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph 39 above), file a petition for the reopening of the above proceedings in respect of which the Court has found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. In these circumstances, ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 3,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "81.  The applicant did not submit any claim for costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the domestic courts or before this Court. The Court therefore considers that there is no call to award him any sum on that account.", "C.  Default interest", "82.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Declares the complaint concerning access to court admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;", "", "3.  Holds", "", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into Croatian kunas at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;", "", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "4.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 19 July 2011, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tSøren Nielsen\tAnatoly Kovler\n\tRegistrar\tPresident", ""]}
