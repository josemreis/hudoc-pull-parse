It originated in an application (no. 17851/91) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a German national, Mrs Dorothea Vogt, on 13 February 1991. ", "2.   In its judgment of 26 September 1995 (\"the principal judgment\", Series A no. 323), the Court held that Mrs Vogt’s dismissal from her post as a teacher with civil-servant status in the employ of the Land of Lower Saxony on account of her political activities as a member of the German Communist Party had breached Article 10 (art. 10) (freedom of expression) and Article 11 (art. 11) (freedom of association) of the Convention (ibid., pp. 22-31, paras. 41-68, and points 1-4 of the operative provisions).  The Court also decided that it was not necessary to consider the case under Article 14 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 10 (art. 14+10) (ibid., p. 31, paras. 69-70, and point 5 of the operative provisions). ", "3.   As the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) was not ready for decision, the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicant to submit their written observations on the matter within the next six months and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., p. 32, para. 74, and point 6 of the operative provisions). ", "4.   On 21 March 1996 the Agent of the Government informed the Registrar of the state of their negotiations with the applicant and asked the Court to assist them in their efforts to resolve the issue of just satisfaction.

Having regard to the terms agreed and to the fact that the Delegate of the Commission had no comment to make, the Court finds that the settlement reached is equitable within the meaning of Rule 54 para. 4 of Rules of Court A.
