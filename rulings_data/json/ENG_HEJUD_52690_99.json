The applicant relied on the 2004 Act on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time. At that time, the proceedings were pending before the District Court following the remittal of the case by the appellate court in 2002.

The court examined only the course of the proceedings after the remittal of the case by the appellate court on 13 November 2002 and found no delays on the part of the District Court.

While the relevant amendments have in essence been aimed at enlarging the scope of the State Treasury’s liability for tort under Article 417 of the Civil Code – which included adding a new Article 4171 and the institution of the State’s tortious liability for its omission to enact legislation (the so-called “legislative omission”; “zaniedbanie legislacyjne”) – they are also to be seen in the context of the operation of a new statute introducing remedies for the unreasonable length of judicial proceedings (see paragraphs 25 below).", "Following the 2004 Amendment, Article 4171 was added which, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:", "“3.  If damage has been caused by a failure to give a ruling (orzeczenie) or decision (decyzja) where there is a statutory duty to give them, reparation for [the damage] may be sought after it has been established in the relevant proceedings that the failure to give a ruling or decision was contrary to the law, unless otherwise provided for by other specific provisions.”", "However, under the transitional provision of section 5 of the 2004 Amendment, Article 417 as applicable before 1 September 2004 (see paragraph 22 above) shall apply to all events and legal situations that subsisted before that date.", "24.  Under Article 442 of the Civil Code the claim for redress of damage caused by a tort becomes time-barred after the lapse of three years from the day on which the person who suffered the damage learns about the damage and about persons or entities liable to make reparation for it.

III SPP 113/04) in which it ruled that while the 2004 Act produced legal effects as from the date of its date of entry into force (17 September 2004), its provisions applied retroactively to all proceedings in which delays had occurred before that date and had not yet been remedied.", "THE LAW", "I.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION", "26.  The applicant complained that the length of both sets of the civil proceedings had been incompatible with the “reasonable time” requirement, provided in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...”", "27.  The Government contested that argument in respect of the first set of proceedings. The Government failed to address the issue of the allegedly unreasonable length of the second set of proceedings.", "28.  With regard to the first set of proceedings the period to be taken into consideration began not on 10 November 1990, when the applicant started the proceedings, but only on 1 May 1993 when the recognition by  of the right of individual petition took effect. The period in question ended on 7 May 1998. It follows that the first set of proceedings lasted five years.", "29.  With regard to the second set of the proceedings the period to be taken into consideration also began on the date when the recognition of  of the right of individual petition took effect and not in 1991 when the applicant initiated the proceedings. The proceedings are still pending. The period to be taken into consideration as regards the second set of proceedings is thus twelve years and over [four months].", "In assessing the reasonableness of the time in question the Court will have regard to the state of both cases on 1 May 1993.", "A.  Admissibility", "1.  First set of proceedings", "30.  The Court first observes, with respect to the requirement of exhaustion of the domestic remedies in the first set of proceedings, that the applicant cannot avail himself of the remedies pursuant to Section 2 read together with Section 5, nor Section 18 of the 2004 Act as the civil proceedings in his case came to end on 7 May 1998, while he lodged his application with the Commission on 18 June 1998. What is more, the Court has already held that a civil action for compensation provided for by Article 417 of the Civil Code read together with Section 16 of the 2004 Act cannot be regarded as an effective remedy if, as in the applicant’s case, more than three years elapsed between the date of the final decision and the entry into force of the 2004 Act, on 17 September 2004 (see, Ratajczyk v. Poland; (dec), 11215/02, 31 May 2005).", "2.  Second set of proceedings", "31.  With respect to the requirement of exhaustion of the domestic remedies in the second set of proceedings, the Court notes that the Government did not address this issue. Nevertheless, the Court notes that the applicant made use of the remedy provided for by the 2004 Act and lodged a complaint about the unreasonable length of the second set of the proceedings. The  dismissed his complaint.", "The Court has already examined that remedy for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention and found it effective in respect of the complaints about the excessive length of judicial proceedings in . In particular, it considered that it was capable both of preventing the alleged violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time or its continuation, and of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see Charzyński v. Poland (dec.), no. 15212/03, §§ 36-42).", "32.  Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicant exhausted domestic remedies in respect of his complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "33.  The Court notes that the applicant’s complaint under the 2004 Act failed. Therefore he can still claim to be a victim, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, of a violation of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time. The Court reiterates that an applicant’s status as a “victim” within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention depends on the fact whether the domestic authorities acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, the alleged infringement of the Convention and, if necessary, provided appropriate redress in relation thereto. Only when these conditions are satisfied does the subsidiary nature of the protective mechanism of the Convention preclude examination of an application (see Cataldo v. Italy (dec.), no. 45656/99, 3 June 2004, with further references).", "34.  The Court notes that the national authorities are in principle better placed than an international court to evaluate the facts of the case. In addition, the Court accepts that the domestic courts enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether the length of proceedings in the case before them exceeded a reasonable time. Nevertheless, in their assessment and appreciation they must apply standards which are in conformity with the principles embodied in the Convention as developed in the caselaw of the Court. In this connection the Court reiterates that the criteria laid down in the Court’s case-law as regards the reasonableness of the length of proceedings are, in particular, the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and that of the relevant authorities, and the importance of what was at stake for the applicant in the litigation.", "35.  The Court has already indicated on a great number of occasions, that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case taken as a whole. The Court’s approach consists in examining the overall length of proceedings and in covering all stages of the proceedings. In the present case the Court notes that the  examined only the period of time after the remittal of the case by the appellate court, i.e. after 13 November 2002. The domestic court did not take into consideration the overall period of the examination of the case by the domestic courts as required by the constant caselaw of the Convention organs. In particular, the  did not consider the period between January 1991, when the proceedings started, and May 2002, when the first-instance judgment was given by the domestic court. Despite the fact that the Regional Court noted that there might have been delays at the earlier stage of the proceedings, nevertheless, it dismissed the applicant’s complaint that the proceedings in his case exceeded reasonable time as it established that it was called to examine only the conduct of the court before which the proceedings were pending at the time of examination of the complaint.", "36.  The Court was in a previous decision satisfied that the domestic court had acknowledged the infringement of the Convention, even if it formally limited its examination to a certain period of time. However, it took into account the state of the proceedings at that time and found a violation of the applicant’s right to a hearing without unjustified delay (see Dubjakova v. Slovakia, (dec), no 67299/01, 19 October 2004). On another occasion, the Court found that the domestic court offered sufficient acknowledgement of the infringement of the right under the consideration, despite the fact that the latter examined separately different stages of the proceedings. Nevertheless, the examination covered all stages of the domestic proceedings (see Bako v , (dec), no 60227/00, 15 March 2005).", "That was not the case in the instant proceedings. Therefore, the Court considers that the  in examining the applicant’s complaint that the length of the proceedings in his case exceeded a reasonable time, failed to apply the standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in the Court’s case-law. Finally, the Court notes that it is not necessary to establish whether the Regional Court’s approach resulted from an error of interpretation or from the construction of the 2004 Act since, in any event, the domestic court’s finding that the length of the proceeding in the applicant’s case did not exceed a reasonable time resulted from the examination of only one stage of the proceedings which could not have afforded appropriate protection to the applicant.", "3.  Conclusion", "37.  Consequently, the Court finds that the application cannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. It further notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. The Court will therefore declare it admissible.", "B.  Merits", "38.  The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, § 43, ECHR 2000-VII and Humen v. Poland [GC], no. 26614/95, § 60, 15 October 1999).", "39.  With regard to the present case the Court notes that the first set of proceedings lasted, within the Court’s jurisdiction ratione temporis, five years while the second set of proceedings has been pending since 1991. The proceedings, in particular the second set, were therefore inordinately lengthy and only exceptional circumstances could justify their overall length.", "40.  The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).", "41.  Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that the length of both sets of civil proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the “reasonable time” requirement.", "There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 § 1.", "II.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "42.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "43.  The applicant claimed 1,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage and EUR 75,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "44.  The Government contested these claims and found them exorbitant.", "45.  The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, the Court considers that the applicant must have sustained nonpecuniary damage. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards award him [EUR 6,000] under that head.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "46.  The applicant also claimed EUR 2,000 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and the Court.", "47.  The Government did not express an opinion on the matter.", "48.  According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer, the sum of [EUR 500] under this head.", "C.  Default interest", "49.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Declares the remainder of the application admissible;", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;", "", "3.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 6,000 (six thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 500 (five hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses, to be converted into Polish zlotys at the rate applicable at the settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "4.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 11 October 2005, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "Michael O’Boyle\tNicolas Bratza\n\tRegistrar\tPresident", ""]}
