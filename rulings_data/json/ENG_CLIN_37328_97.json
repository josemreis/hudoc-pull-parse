His lawyer, a former inmate of the prison who had not represented him in the criminal proceedings, complained to various authorities that his letters to the applicant had been opened and withheld, despite being marked “from lawyer to client”. Correspondence between the applicant and the European Commission of Human Rights was also opened by the prison authorities.", "Law: Government’s preliminary objection – It appeared from various reports, in particular reports of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), that the situation in the Netherlands Antilles prisons was, and continued to be, characterised by serious structural problems. There existed a remedy before the civil courts, whereby prisoners might obtain a ruling as to the compatibility of administrative acts with their Convention rights and, if need be, obtain injunctions, and the applicant had not availed himself of that remedy. However, it clearly appeared that the authorities of the Netherlands Antilles had remained totally passive for more than a year in complying with court injunctions ordering them to repair rather serious structural shortcomings of an elementary hygienic and humanitarian nature in prison facilities. In the absence of convincing explanations from the Government for the failure to take the necessary measures within a reasonable time to rectify the problems criticised in the reports and to comply with the court orders, there were special circumstances which dispensed the applicant from the obligation to exhaust the remedy referred to.", "Article 8 – It was not contested that the prison authorities had interfered with the applicant’s right to respect for his correspondence. Moreover, the interferences had a legal basis.", "(a) correspondence with the Commission – no reasons had been disclosed or substantiated which could justify the control of the applicant’s correspondence with a Convention organ, the confidentiality of which must be respected.", "Conclusion: violation (unanimously).", "(b) correspondence with lawyer – the rules at the time did not allow a prisoner to correspond with a former inmate, but while it may be necessary to control such correspondence having regard to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment, there were no grounds justifying a blanket prohibition.", "Conclusion: violation (unanimously).", "(c) other correspondence – the applicant’s allegations were wholly unsubstantiated and while under the rules in force at the time his correspondencen would have been subject to control, in the absence of concrete evidence the facts did not disclose a violation.", "Conclusion: no violation (unanimously).", "(d) limited facilities for letter-writing and telephoning – the rules in force at the time allowed detainees to send two or three letters per week and to receive letters at all times, and the costs of writing materials and postage were borne by the prison authorities. In these circumstances, the possibilities for the applicant to maintain contact by letter with persons outside prison were not arbitrarily or unreasonably restricted. As to telephone facilities, Article 8 cannot be interpreted as guaranteeing prisoners the right to make telephone calls, in particular where the facilities for contact by way of correspondence are  available and adequate. Where telephone facilities are provided, they be made subject to legitimate restrictions.", "Conclusion: no violation (unanimously).", "Article 13 – In view of the finding in respect of the Government’s preliminary objection, and in particular the lack of adequate implementation by the authorities of court orders to repair the shortcomings in prisons, as well as the failure to implement the recommendations of the CPT, the applicant did not have an effective remedy in respect of his Convention complaints.", "Conclusion: violation (unanimously).", "Article 41 – The Court awarded the applicant € 3,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the "]}
