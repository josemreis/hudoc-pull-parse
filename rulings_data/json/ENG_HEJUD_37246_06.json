He invokes Articles 3, 6 and 13 of the Convention.", "The Court, which is master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of the case, finds that the above complaints fall to be examined solely under the procedural limb of Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "Article 3", "“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”", "A.  Admissibility", "52.  The Government did not submit any observations on the admissibility of this complaint.", "53.  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "54.  The Government submitted that the investigation in the present case had included the questioning of eighteen witnesses, the questioning of the victim on four occasions, and the questioning of K. on seven occasions. There had been four forensic medical examinations and one forensic ballistic examination. Since all the persons involved were minors, the investigation had required particular diligence and caution.", "55.  The Government further reiterated that the applicant’s father had initially not wanted to have K. prosecuted, and had later been given the opportunity to participate fully in the investigation.", "56.  Thus, the Government stated, the State authorities had taken all possible measures to secure the evidence in the case, which had required particular diligence, and had secured the applicant’s right to participate in the investigation. As a result the guilty person had been identified and his actions had been correctly classified. The State had therefore complied with its obligations under Article 3 of the Convention in the present case.", "57.  In reply, the applicant argued that the questioning of witnesses and the forensic examinations should not, in the circumstances of the case, have taken more than half a year. Instead the proceedings in the case had lasted for eight years. The applicant believed that the State authorities had intentionally protracted the proceedings so that K. would be spared responsibility.", "58. The Court notes at the outset that as a result of the violent actions of a private individual, K., the applicant sustained grievous bodily harm, lost the sight in his left eye and became disabled. Thus, the treatment to which he was subjected reached the threshold of severity necessary to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention (see, a contrario, Tonchev v. , no. 18527/02, § 38-40, 19 November 2009).", "59.  The Court further reiterates that its case-law is consistent and clear on the point that Article 3 of the Convention requires that the authorities conduct an effective official investigation into alleged ill-treatment even if such treatment has been inflicted by private individuals (see Ay v. Turkey, no. 30951/96, § 60, 22 March 2005, and M.C. v. , no. 39272/98, § 151, ECHR 2003XII and, most recently, Biser Kostov v. Bulgaria, no. 32662/06, 10 January 2012).", "60.  In particular, Article 3 requires States to put in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against personal integrity, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. On the other hand, it goes without saying that the obligation on the State under Article 1 of the Convention cannot be interpreted as requiring the State to guarantee through its legal system that inhuman or degrading treatment is never inflicted by one individual on another or that, if it is, criminal proceedings should necessarily lead to a particular sanction. In order that a State may be held responsible it must in the view of the Court be shown that the domestic legal system, and in particular the criminal law applicable in the circumstances of the case, fails to provide practical and effective protection of the rights guaranteed by Article 3 (see Beganović v. , no. 46423/06, § 71, 25 June 2009, with further references).", "61.  The minimum standards of effectiveness laid down by the Court’s case-law include the requirements that the investigation must be independent, impartial and subject to public scrutiny, and that the competent authorities must act with exemplary diligence and promptness (see, mutatis mutandis, Menesheva v. Russia, no. 59261/00, § 67, ECHR 2006-III).", "62.  The procedural requirements of Article 3 go beyond the preliminary investigation stage when, as in this case, the investigation leads to legal action being taken before the national courts: the proceedings as a whole, including the trial stage, must meet the requirements of the prohibition enshrined in Article 3. This means that the domestic judicial authorities must on no account be prepared to let the physical or psychological suffering inflicted go unpunished. This is essential for maintaining the public’s confidence in, and support for, the rule of law and for preventing any appearance of the authorities’ tolerance of or collusion in unlawful acts (see, mutatis mutandis, Okkalı v. Turkey, no. 52067/99, § 65, ECHR 2006 XII (extracts)).", "63.  In the present case, the Court notes that the criminal proceedings in the case against the applicant’s assailant lasted for eight and a half years - from 20 June 2000, when the police were informed about the incident, until 23 December 2008, when the court terminated the proceedings in the case as the time-limit for prosecution had expired.", "64.  The Court notes that the case before the national authorities does not appear to have been complicated. The circumstances of the case were clear and the incident was limited to only one episode and involved a small number of witnesses. It took the national authorities, however, more than eight years to investigate the case. The case was several times referred for additional investigation, in particular, for failure to determine the main issues in the case (the degree of severity of the injuries inflicted and K.’s intent to inflict them) after four years of investigation and court proceedings (see paragraph 30 above). By the time the final decision in the applicant’s case was taken, a criminal prosecution of K. had become time-barred.", "65.  The Court further notes that the proceedings included significant periods of inactivity. In particular, the proceedings were stayed for unknown reasons for half a year (see paragraph 16 above) and it took the national authorities more than two years to perform the final forensic medical examination in the applicant’s case (see paragraphs 42 and 44 above). The protracted character of the investigation and court proceedings was recognised by the national authorities themselves (see paragraphs 24 and 47 above).", "66.  In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that in the present case the authorities failed to conduct an effective investigation into the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment, which led to the expiry of the relevant deadline and made it impossible to pursue prosecution any further. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention under its procedural limb.", "II.  OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION", "67.  The applicant also complained that the proceedings in the criminal case against K. had been unfair. He invoked Articles 6 and 14 of the Convention.", "68.  Having carefully examined the applicant’s submissions in the light of all the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention.", "69.  It follows that this part of the application must be declared inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.", "III.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "70.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "71.  The applicant claimed 75,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "72.  The Government stated that the applicant’s claims were unsubstantiated.", "73.  The Court, deciding on an equitable basis, awards the applicant EUR 7,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "74.  The applicant did not claim any costs and expenses.", "C.  Default interest", "75.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Declares the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention concerning ineffective investigation admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention under its procedural limb;", "", "3.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months of the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 7,500 (seven thousand five hundred euros), to be converted into Ukrainian hryvnas at the rate applicable on the date of settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "4.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 31 July 2012, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tStephen Phillips\tDean Spielmann\n\tDeputy Registrar\tPresident"]}
