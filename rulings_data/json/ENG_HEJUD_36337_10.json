On 14 April 2009 the judge asked the Centre to extend the guardian’s authority to the representation of the applicant in the criminal proceedings in issue.

Municipal] Court containing detailed descriptions and complaints. The submissions in the case file show that the second defendant is very literate, giving detailed descriptions (often insignificant for the court proceedings) which appear convincing. It is also to be noted that she studied the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure for the purpose of communicating with this court, which indicates a high degree of intelligence.", "The medical documentation has no date and does not bear the stamp of the institution or name of the person who carried out the examination. The second defendant concealed that information by photocopying the document, owing to her suspicion and distrust, which is typical of paranoid persons. For the same reason, the second defendant took away her medical record on 24 April 2007, that is, the day after the hearing at which it was decided that a psychiatric assessment should be carried out. It is not known whether she submitted her medical record to another medical institution, but it would not be surprising if, because of the nature of her mental disorder, she were holding that record in her possession.", "All the available information leads to the conclusion that the second defendant, M. S., suffers from mental illness which may be diagnosed as a psychotic disorder.", "...”", "The psychiatrist concluded that both the applicant and her sister suffered from a persistent psychotic disorder and that tempore criminis they had both been unaccountable.", "39.  On 10 April 2010 the proceedings were terminated on the ground that both the applicant and her sister had committed the offence while suffering from a mental illness.", "D.  Proceedings to divest the applicant of legal capacity", "40.  On 14 April 2008 the judge conducting the above-mentioned criminal proceedings against the applicant and her sister sent a letter to the O.

Social Welfare Centre (“the Centre”) informing them that she had carried out a psychiatric assessment of the applicant and her sister for the purposes of the criminal proceedings against them before the O.

The relevant part of the letter reads:", "“The available sources ... indicate a manifest mental illness of the persons concerned which is expressed in psychosis of a paranoid character (relational ideas, ideas of persecution) primarily directed at one person (M.M., possibly together with a new tenant in the same building, E.L.), and the number of persons by whom the persons concerned feel threatened is growing (the trial judge, the President [of the O. Municipal] Court, police officers). The persons concerned frequently make complaints against these persons in which, for the time being, they simply insult, sully and threaten them. Given that paranoid persons have no control over themselves, that they feel threatened, that they insist on their rights, expecting a favourable outcome (which does not happen – that is to say that their problems are not resolved because the police do not respond – they fabricate their statements and encourage the persons who are threatening them ...).", "The persons concerned are obviously dissatisfied with the system; they constantly write letters, fax submissions ... An abundance of psychopathology is evident, in particular in the copies of material written by M.S. (enclosed with your letter of 16 May 2008). Increasingly serious psychopathology is apparent, their anxiety is growing and eventually, with the aim of resolving their problems, the persons concerned may take justice into their own hands in an attempt to resolve their problems, which could manifest as aggression directed at the persons who are threatening them.", "The behaviour of I. and M.S. shows that they do not take care of their (mental) health, which is only logical since they have no awareness of their condition and illness. But, their behaviour jeopardises the rights and interests of other persons, namely those at whom their psychosis is directed, or those that they feel threatened by. Their behaviour threatens the existence of the M. family; they inundate the police and the State Attorney’s Office with letters; they seek examinations by medical personnel ...", "They behave in this way because of their mental illness, owing to which they lack introspection and self-awareness.", "Against the above [background], I am of the opinion that there is a basis for depriving [them] of their legal capacity.”", "43.  On 26 June 2008 the Centre asked the O. Municipal Court to institute proceedings with a view to divesting the applicant and her sister of legal capacity.

M.S. drawn up for the purposes of the criminal proceedings against her ... indicates that she is mentally disturbed, suffering from a chronic psychotic disorder.

Belgium, 6 November 1980, Series A no. 40, § 35).", "64.  The Croatian legislation distinguishes between criminal offences to be prosecuted by the State Attorney’s Office, either of its own motion or upon a private application, and those to be prosecuted by means of a private prosecution.", "65.  Article 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows for criminal proceedings to be instituted only at the request of an qualified prosecutor. In respect of criminal offences to be prosecuted by the State, the only qualified prosecutor is the State Attorney, while in respect of other criminal offences, the qualified prosecutor is a private prosecutor, in principle the injured party.", "66.  Furthermore, Article 98 of the Criminal Code expressly provides that criminal proceedings for the offence of inflicting bodily injury shall be instituted by means of a private prosecution.", "67.  In the present case the applicant and her sister brought a private prosecution in the O. Municipal Court against M.Č. on charges of inflicting bodily injury. Had the Municipal Court considered that they were not authorised to bring such a prosecution, it could not have proceeded with the case. However, that court accepted its jurisdiction in the case and conducted the criminal proceedings in the private prosecution brought by the applicant and her sister. It thus accepted that they were authorised prosecutors within the meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, the applicant had no reason to make a request to the State Attorney’s Office for the prosecution of M.Č.", "68.  As regards the Government’s contention that the applicant did not lodge a constitutional complaint, the Court notes that it is true that the applicant herself did not lodge such a complaint. Her sister, who was a party to the same proceedings, lodged a constitutional complaint whereby she complained, inter alia, about the fact that the criminal proceedings against M.Č. had been terminated. The , however, declared it inadmissible on the ground that the decision terminating the criminal proceedings against M.Č. had not been arbitrary.", "69.  The Court considers that in this way the domestic authorities were afforded the opportunity to remedy the violation alleged. It further considers that there is no reason to believe that a different decision would have been reached in respect of a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant herself. Accordingly, in the circumstances of the present case the Government’s argument in this regard should be rejected.", "70.  The Court further considers that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It is not inadmissible on any other ground and must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The parties’ arguments", "71.  The applicant maintained that the national authorities had not provided her with adequate protection against a violent attack by a private individual.", "72.  The Government maintained that the applicant’s allegations of violence were not credible because the applicant had submitted a large number of complaints to the police and the State Attorney’s Office which had turned out to be unfounded. Furthermore, a police inquiry had shown that the applicant had not been attacked by anyone.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "73.  While the essential object of Article 8 is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities, there may in addition be positive obligations inherent in an effective “respect” for private and family life, and these obligations may involve the adoption of measures in the sphere of the relations of individuals between themselves (see, mutatis mutandis, X and Y v. the Netherlands, X and Y v. , no. 5193/09, §§ 23-24, 3 November 2011; Mikulić v. Croatia, no. 53176/99, § 57, ECHR 2002I and 27; and Sandra Janković v. Croatia, no. 38478/05, § 44, 5 March 2009).", "74.  The Court has previously held, in various contexts, that the concept of private life includes a person’s physical and psychological integrity. Under Article 8 States have a duty to protect the physical and moral integrity of an individual from other persons. To that end they are to maintain and apply in practice an adequate legal framework affording protection against acts of violence by private individuals (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, cited above, §§ 22 and 23; Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1993, § 36, Series A no. 247-C; D.P. and J.C. v. the United Kingdom, no. 38719/97, § 118, 10 October 2002; M.C. v. Bulgaria, cited above, §§ 150 and 152; Bevacqua and S. v. Bulgaria, no. 71127/01, § 65, 12 June 2008; and Sandra Janković, cited above, § 45).", "75.  As to the present case, the Court notes that the applicant alleged that the attacker had kicked and hit her. The medical documentation shows that the applicant sustained a contusion and haematoma on her right hand and her right hip, and a further contusion on her right shin. Her right ankle and right hand were swollen and she had a painful neck. Acts of violence such as those alleged by the applicant require the States to adopt adequate positive measures in the sphere of criminal-law protection. Where attacks on one’s physical integrity come from a private individual, the Convention does not necessarily require a State-assisted prosecution against the attacker in order to secure the applicant’s Convention rights (see Sandra Janković, cited above, §§ 50-51). Where the domestic law affords an applicant a possibility to pursue the prosecution of his or her attacker, either as a private prosecutor or as the injured party in the role of a subsidiary prosecutor, and the applicant has availed him or herself of this possibility, the Court must examine the effectiveness and the manner in which that criminal-law mechanism was implemented (see, mutatis mutandis, V.D. v. Croatia, no. 15526/10, § 84, 8 November 2011, and Butolen v. Slovenia, no. 41356/08, §§ 69-70, 26 April 2012).", "76.  As to the criminal-law mechanisms provided in the Croatian legal system, the Court found in the Sandra Janković case that violent acts committed by private individuals were prohibited under a number of separate provisions of the Croatian Criminal Code.", "77.  Furthermore, as to the sphere of criminal law, Croatian legislation distinguishes between criminal offences to be prosecuted by the State Attorney’s Office, either of its own motion or upon a private application, and those to be prosecuted by means of a private prosecution. Thus, the requirement of providing criminal-law mechanisms in respect of violent acts by private parties has been satisfied.", "78.  However, providing an appropriate legal framework for protecting individuals from violent attacks on their personal integrity is not sufficient. The Court will next examine whether or not the impugned regulations and practices, and in particular the domestic authorities’ compliance with the relevant procedural rules, as well as the manner in which the criminal-law mechanisms were implemented in the instant case, were defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent State’s positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention (see Sandra Janković, cited above, § 51).", "79.  As to the present case, on 22 May 2003 the applicant and her sister, I., brought a private prosecution in the O. Municipal Court against M.Č. for verbal assault and inflicting bodily injury. A first-instance judgment finding M.Č. guilty of inflicting bodily injury on the applicant was adopted on 10 February 2005, but was quashed upon appeal by the R. County Court on 21 February 2007.", "80.  However, in the resumed proceedings the judge conducting the proceedings, upon learning that proceedings for divesting the applicant and her sister of their legal capacity had been instituted, asked that the authority of the special guardians appointed for them in those proceedings be extended to representing them also in the criminal proceedings in issue. Thus, the consent of the guardians became a requirement for the continuation of the proceedings, whereas there are no provisions in the Croatian legal system addressing a possible conflict of wishes between a guardian and the person placed under guardianship.", "81.  The guardians stated that they were not able to pronounce on whether or not they gave their consent to the continuation of the criminal proceedings in issue (see paragraph 27 above). On 28 April 2009 the proceedings were terminated on the ground that on 21 April 2009 a special guardian had been appointed for the applicant who had not expressly given her consent to those proceedings being conducted, and that therefore there was no request by an authorised prosecutor for the proceedings to be conducted. Further remedies resorted to by the applicant and her sister were unsuccessful.", "82.  Thus, the facts surrounding the alleged attack on the applicant were never established by a competent court of law. In this connection, the Court notes that one of the main purposes of imposing criminal sanctions is to restrain and deter the offender from causing further harm. However, these aims can hardly be obtained without having the facts of the case established by a competent criminal court.", "83.  In the Court’s view, the outcome of the criminal proceedings in the present case cannot be said to have had a sufficient deterrent effect or to have been capable of ensuring the effective prevention of unlawful acts such as those complained of by the applicant.", "84.  In this light, and also having regard to the fact that the proceedings were pending for almost six years, the Court considers that the impugned practices did not, in the circumstances of the present case, provide adequate protection to the applicant against an attack on her physical integrity, and that the manner in which the criminal-law mechanisms were implemented in the instant case was defective to the point of constituting a violation of the respondent State’s positive obligations under Article 8 of the Convention.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROCEEDINGS FOR DIVESTING THE APPLICANT OF LEGAL CAPACITY", "85.  The applicant, relying on Article 8 of the Convention, complained that the institution of proceedings with a view to divesting her of legal capacity had violated her right to respect for her private life. The text of Article 8 of the Convention is set out above.", "A.  Admissibility", "86.  The Government argued that any complaint in respect of the proceedings concerning the applicant’s legal capacity was premature since they were still pending. They further noted that the applicant had not lodged an appeal against the decision of the Centre to appoint its employee T.T. as her guardian ad litem for the proceedings to divest her of her legal capacity.", "87.  The Court notes that the applicant complains that the institution of court proceedings with a view to divesting her of legal capacity amounted to an unjustified interference with her right to respect for her private life. In view of the nature of this complaint, the question whether the applicant’s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention in connection with the institution of proceedings to divest her of legal capacity is premature because the proceedings are still pending is closely linked to the merits of this complaint. Likewise, the issue of lodging an appeal against the said decision is also closely linked to the substance of the applicant’s complaint concerning the proceedings in issue. Therefore, the Government’s objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies should be joined to the merits.", "88.  The Court further considers that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. Moreover, it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The parties’ arguments", "89.  The applicant argued that the institution of the proceedings for divesting her of legal capacity violated her right to respect for her private life.", "90.  The Government firstly maintained that the institution of the proceedings in issue could not be seen as an interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her private life. The legal consequences of divesting a person of his or her legal capacity came into play only after the decision to that effect became final. In the proceedings in issue a complete psychiatric assessment of the applicant’s mental health would be carried out. In these proceedings the applicant was represented by a guardian ad litem whose competences were prescribed by law.", "91.  Were the Court to find that there had been an interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her private life, the Government argued that such an interference was based on law, namely, the Family Act. Moreover, a competent social welfare centre was obliged to institute proceedings for divesting of his or her legal capacity a person who placed at risk the rights and interests of others.", "92.  The “interference” had also pursued a legitimate aim, namely the protection of the rights and interests of others. It had been necessary in a democratic society since the applicant, owning to her mental illness, had lodged a large number of criminal complaints against various persons.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "(a)  Whether there has been an interference", "93.  In the case of X and Y v. Croatia (cited above) the Court held as follows:", "“102. The Court considers that a measure such as divesting one of legal capacity amounts to a serious interference with that person’s private life. In this connection the Court notes that the mere institution of these proceedings already has serious consequences. Thus, a special guardian is appointed for the person concerned and represents him or her in the court proceedings, and the person is subject to various assessments, including a psychiatric report, all of which concern one’s private life.", "103. Further, in the present case the guardian appointed to the second applicant was given a wide range of powers, such as representing her in all personal matters and matters concerning her property, managing her assets and taking proper care of her person, rights, obligations and well-being. The Court therefore considers that the institution of the proceedings with a view to divesting the second applicant of legal capacity amounted to an interference with her private life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention.", "104. Any such interference with the right to respect for one’s private life will constitute a violation of Article 8 unless it is “in accordance with the law”, pursues an aim or aims that are legitimate under paragraph 2 of this provision and can be regarded as “necessary in a democratic society” (see Anayo v. Germany, no. 20578/07, § 63, 21 December 2010; and Mikolajová v. Slovakia, no. 4479/03, § 58, 18 January 2011).", "The Court does not see any reason to depart from these conclusions in the present case.", "(b)  Whether the interference was based on law, pursued a legitimate aim and was necessary in a democratic society", "94.  In the circumstances of the present case the Court considers that the issues of the legality of the interference, the legitimate aim pursued and its necessity are closely interconnected, and it will examine them together (see, by way of comparison, X and Y v. Croatia, cited above, § 105).", "95.  As to the legal basis for the interference concerned, the Court notes that section 159 of the Family Act provides that an adult unable to care for his or her own needs, rights and interests, or who presents a risk to the rights and interests of others on account of mental illness or other reasons, may be partly or completely divested of legal capacity.", "96.  In the Court’s view, in order to be able to institute such proceedings a social welfare centre (or any other authority) should be able to present convincing evidence that the person concerned is either unable to care for his or her own needs, rights and interests, or presents a risk to the rights and interests of others. This cannot be done on the basis of general statements but only on the basis of specific facts (see X and Y v. Croatia, cited above, § 107).", "97.  The Court considers that in deciding whether proceedings to divest a person of legal capacity are proportionate, the national authorities are to be recognised as having a certain margin of appreciation. It is in the first place for the national authorities to evaluate the evidence adduced before them in a particular case; the Court’s task is to review under the Convention the decisions of those authorities (see, mutatis mutandis, Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, § 40, Series A no. 33; Luberti v. Italy, 23 February 1984, Series A no. 75, § 27; and Shtukaturov v. Russia, no. 44009/05, § 67, 27 March 2008). In this connection, the Court would like to stress that strict scrutiny is called for where measures that have such adverse effect on a person’s personal autonomy are at stake. In this connection the Court is mindful that divesting someone of legal capacity entails grave consequences for various spheres of that person’s life (see X and Y v. Croatia, cited above, § 109).", "98.  The institution of such proceedings, which oblige the person concerned to submit himself or herself to court proceedings in which he or she is represented by a guardian and where various aspects of his or her private life are examined and questioned and his or her mental condition, behaviour and personality are assessed, is justified where convincing evidence exists that a measure to divest that person of legal capacity is an adequate answer to the situation in issue (see X and Y v. Croatia, cited above, § 111).", "99.  In the present case, in its request of 26 June 2008 the Centre claimed that it had been established by a psychiatrist in a report commissioned for the purposes of the criminal proceedings against the applicant and her sister that both of them suffered from a persistent psychotic disorder and that this in itself required the institution of proceedings for divesting both of them of their legal capacity.", "100.  The Centre’s request relied solely on the psychiatric report mentioned above. As to that report, the Court notes, however, that it was drawn up in the context of criminal proceedings against the applicant by a psychiatrist who had never had any contact with her. The Court recalls that in its judgment X and Y v. Croatia it expressed severe doubts as to a report drawn up by a psychiatrist who had not previously treated the applicant and who had held only a telephone conversation with her. Likewise, in the present case the Court is sceptical as to whether the applicant’s mental condition could have been assessed with sufficient certainty without the psychiatrist having seen the applicant, in particular given the significance of such a report.", "101.  The Court also stresses that the institution of proceedings to divest a person of his or her legal capacity has to be subject to the relevant procedural safeguards. The Court’s task in the present case is to review under the Convention the decisions that the Croatian authorities took in the exercise of their power of appreciation.", "102.  The proceedings in issue were instituted on the basis of the Centre’s request of 26 June 2008. However, the documents in the case file do not indicate that there had been any contact between the Centre’s personnel and the applicant prior to the submission of that request. The Centre had made only one attempt to visit the applicant at her address.", "103.  As stated above, the request lodged by the Centre relied solely on the views expressed by a psychiatrist who had had no contact with the applicant. There is no indication that the opinion of any doctor who had had regular contact with the applicant over a longer period of time was obtained. Even though the decision of 15 September 2008 mentions an attempt to contact the applicant’s general practitioner, there is no indication in the case file of any follow-up in that regard.", "104.  As regards the representation of the applicant in those proceedings, the Court notes that an employee of the Centre was appointed as the applicant’s guardian ad litem. However, given that it was the Centre itself that had instituted the proceedings for divesting the applicant of her legal capacity, it would be difficult to expect an employee of that same Centre to oppose or challenge such a request. The Court is also mindful of the fact that the national law does not provide for obligatory representation of the person concerned by an independent lawyer, despite the very serious nature of the issues concerned and the possible consequences of such proceedings.", "105.  The Convention does not lay down for the Contracting States any given manner for ensuring within their internal law the effective implementation of the Convention. The choice as to the most appropriate means of achieving this is in principle a matter for the domestic authorities, who are in continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries and are better placed to assess the possibilities and resources afforded by their respective domestic legal systems (see Chapman v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27238/95, § 91, ECHR 2001-I; and Sisojeva and Others v. Latvia [GC], no. 60654/00, § 90, ECHR 2007-II). However, the Court notes that in the present case neither was the request by the Centre supported by adequate justification, arguments and evidence, nor was the applicant given a possibility to object ab initio to the institution of the proceedings at issue.", "106.  Having regard to this and to the specific situation where the Centre’s request relied solely on a report drawn up by a psychiatrist who had never had any contact with the applicant, where the Centre itself had had no contact with the applicant, and where the applicant had no prior history of mental illness, the Court considers that the institution of court proceedings with a view to divesting the applicant of legal capacity did not comply with the procedure and requirements prescribed by law (see paragraph 56 above), did not pursue a legitimate aim and was not necessary in a democratic society.", "107.  As to the Government’s objection that the applicant did not exhaust domestic remedies (see paragraphs 87 and 88 above), the Court notes that the institution of the proceedings in issue amounted to an interference and therefore the fact that those proceedings are still pending cannot render the complaint relating to them premature. As regards the possibility for the applicant to challenge the appointment of the guardian, the Court considers that the only relevant remedy as regards that complaint would be a possibility for the applicant to challenge the institution of the proceedings for divesting her of legal capacity, which is not an option under Croatian law.", "108.  Against the above background, the Court rejects the Government’s objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies and finds that there has been a violation of Article 8 as regards the institution of the proceedings for divesting the applicant of legal capacity.", "III.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION", "109.  The applicant complained that her right to a fair trial had been violated because the civil proceedings in which she had sought repossession of a wood shed and compensation for its use had been stayed. She relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the relevant part of which reads as follows:", "“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...”", "Admissibility", "110.  The Court notes that the proceedings in issue are still pending and therefore any complaint relating to them is premature.", "111.  It follows that this complaint must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.", "IV.  OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION", "112.  The applicant also invoked Articles 5, 7 and 13 of the Convention, as well as Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 and Articles 2 and 4 of Protocol No. 7, without further substantiation.", "113.  In the light of all the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court considers that this part of the application does not disclose any appearance of a violation of the Convention. It follows that it is inadmissible under Article 35 § 3 (a) as manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 § 4 of the Convention.”", "V.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "114.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "115.  The applicant did not submit a claim for just satisfaction or for costs and expenses. Accordingly, the Court considers that there is no call to award her any sum on these accounts.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Decides to join to the merits the Government’s objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies and rejects it;", "", "2.  Declares the complaints under Article 8 of the Convention concerning the alleged inadequacy of protection against the alleged attack on the applicant by M.Č. and the institution of the proceedings for divesting her of legal capacity admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;", "", "3.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention due to the inadequate protection against the alleged attack on the applicant’s physical integrity;", "", "4.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention due to the institution of the proceedings to divest the applicant of legal capacity;", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 25 April 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tSøren Nielsen\tIsabelle Berro-Lefèvre\n\tRegistrar\tPresident"]}
