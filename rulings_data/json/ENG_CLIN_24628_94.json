Held: Commission’s Rules of Procedure did not imply that applicant had to prove, as a prerequisite to registration of his application, compliance with the six-month time-limit – an application was lodged on date of applicant’s first letter provided applicant had sufficiently indicated application’s purpose.", "Government had argued that applicant had failed to find out from Court of Cassation’s registry when judgment was to be delivered.
