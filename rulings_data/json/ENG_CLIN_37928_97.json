A journalist had come to meet the applicant in his surgery in order to discuss a new laser operation technique. An article was subsequently published in a newspaper. In the interview it was reported that the applicant had treated 400 patients using this laser technique, with 100% success. The applicant was reported to have stated that such operations depended notably on the professional experience of the practitioner. The article was also illustrated by a photograph of the applicant in his surgery. The Disciplinary Court considered that he had disregarded several provisions of the Rules of Professional Ethics, whereby no article concerning a practitioner and of an advertising character should be published. The applicant had breached these rules in giving a percentage of success of the operations he had carried out, referring to his professional experience and letting a photograph of him, taken in his professional environment, illustrate the article. The Disciplinary Appeals Court for Medical Practitioners dismissed his appeal and the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit his constitutional complaint.", "Admissible under Article 10.", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the "]}
