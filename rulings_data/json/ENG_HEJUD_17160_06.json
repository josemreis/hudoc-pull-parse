The Court considers, therefore, that it is not now appropriate to take the matter up separately (see, mutatis mutandis, Piryanik v. Ukraine, no. 75788/01, § 20, 19 April 2005). It will be dealt with in application no. 53744/10.", "III.  THE COMPLAINTS OF LACK OF ACCESS TO ", "24.  The applicants complained that they had been unlawfully denied access to a court of cassation in their cases. They relied on Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention.", "25.  The Court notes that the applicants' complaints fall to be examined solely under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal...”", "A.  Admissibility", "26.  The Government submitted that the applicants had not exhausted the domestic remedies available to them, as they had not requested the renewal of the term provided for lodging an appeal in cassation with the  under Article 102 of the Code of Administrative Justice.", "27.  The Government also argued that the applicants had failed to lodge with the Supreme Court requests for review of the decisions of the Higher Administrative Court of 24 March (in the first applicant's case) and 11 April 2006 (in the second applicant's case) in the light of exceptional circumstances pursuant to Article 237 of the Code of Administrative Justice. According to the Government, the issue concerned the dissimilar application of procedural law by the Supreme Court and the  in the applicants' cases, falling within the ambit of the first subparagraph of that provision of domestic law.", "28.  The applicants disagreed.", "29.  The Court reiterates that the only remedies to be exhausted by an applicant are those which are effective. It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in both theory and practice at the relevant time (see, for instance, Miroshnik v. Ukraine, no. 75804/01, § 53, 27 November 2008).", "30.  The Court considers that the Government's argument that it was incumbent upon the applicants to lodge a request for the renewal of the term for lodging an appeal in cassation is closely linked to the substance of the applicants' complaints and that it must therefore be joined to the Court's consideration of the merits of the application.", "31.  As regards the Government's second objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies, the Court recalls that it has already found in a case against Ukraine that requests for review of court decisions made in the light of exceptional circumstances, as envisaged by the Code of Administrative Justice, are akin to requests for the re-opening of the proceedings (see Karuna v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 43788/05, 3 April 2007). In this context, the Court reiterates that the Convention does not guarantee a right to have a case re-opened by means of an extraordinary remedy (see, mutatis mutandis, Prystavska v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 21287/02, 17 December 2002). Having regard to the parties' submissions on this aspect of the case, and, in particular, given the Government's failure to submit any examples of cases in which the present issue of access to a court of cassation was resolved through the impugned procedure, the Court discerns no grounds to depart from the findings it reached in Karuna (cited above). Moreover, the Court notes that such findings are consistent with its practice concerning the extraordinary review procedure in the civil law matters in the Ukrainian legal system (see Nesterova v. Ukraine, no. 10792/04, § 36, 28 May 2009). Therefore, the Court holds that the applicants were not required to pursue the procedure suggested by the Government, as it was not a remedy within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.", "32.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government's objection in this latter regard. It finds that the applicants' complaints of lack of access to court are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. The Court further finds that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds and must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "33.  The Court reiterates that the right to court, of which the right of access is one aspect, is not absolute: it may be subject to limitations permitted by implication, particularly as regards the conditions of admissibility of an appeal. However, these limitations must not restrict the exercise of the right in such a way or to such an extent that its very essence is impaired. They must pursue a legitimate aim and there must be a reasonable degree of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved.", "34.  The rules on time-limits for appeals are undoubtedly designed to ensure the proper administration of justice and legal certainty. Those concerned must expect such rules to be applied. However, the rules in question, or the application of them, should not prevent litigants from making use of an available remedy (see Melnyk v. Ukraine, no. 23436/03, §§ 22-23, 28 March 2006).", "35.  The Court notes that, according to its established case-law concerning Ukraine, the above guarantees enshrined in Article 6 are applicable to proceedings before courts of cassation in both civil and administrative matters, regardless of their Ukrainian classification (see Melnyk, § 25, cited above, and Karuna, cited above).", "36.  Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the applicants had access to a court of cassation, in that their appeals reached both the Supreme Court and the . However, their appeals were not considered because the latter court found that they had been lodged out of time.", "37.  Although the applicants contended that the decisions of the  had not been in compliance with relevant procedural law, the Court does not find it necessary to examine whether the relevant rules were accurately construed by the domestic court. The latter was better placed to interpret the domestic rules of procedure, in particular those concerning procedural time-limits.", "38.  The Court also considers that it is not necessary to determine whether after the entry into force of the Code of Administrative Procedure on 1 September 2005 the applicants should have been aware that their cases would be dealt with under the rules of administrative procedure.", "39.  What is important in the present circumstances is that the courts of appeal expressly dealt with the applicants' cases under the rules of civil procedure. Furthermore, their decisions clearly indicated that an appeal in cassation had to be lodged with the Supreme Court within two months, that is, the period for lodging appeals under the new rules of civil procedure. Thus, the courts of appeal explicitly guided the applicants to pursue their cases through the civil procedure route (see paragraphs 7, 12, and 22 above). Even if a statement in the operative part of a judgment cannot necessarily be regarded as binding on the subsequent jurisdiction, the statement of the courts of appeal that the applicants had two months in which to make their appeal was in the circumstances – in particular, the fact that the events took place shortly after substantial changes in the procedural legislation, and no other guidance appears to have been available – the only reliable guidance for the applicants.", "40.  In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the decision of the  to apply the one-month time-limit in each case, resulting in the refusal to consider the applicants' appeals in cassation on the merits, was not proportionate to the purpose of the impugned procedural limitation. To hold otherwise would be too formalistic and contrary to the principle of practical and effective application of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Christian Democratic People's Party v.  (no. 2), no. 25196/04, § 25, 2 February 2010).", "41.  The Court further finds that, in the circumstances, the applicants should not be reproached for not seeking the renewal of the term set for lodging appeals in cassation in administrative cases, as they acted in full conformity with the guidance of the courts of appeal, of which the Higher Administrative Court was or should have been aware when dealing with the applicants' appeals in cassation. The Court therefore dismisses the Government's objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies previously joined to the merits (see paragraphs 26 and 30 above).", "42.  There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "IV.  THE REMAINING COMPLAINTS", "43.  The applicants complained under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention of the outcome and unfairness of the proceedings, alleging that the courts had been biased and that they had assessed the evidence and applied the law wrongly in their cases. The first applicant also complained under the same provisions of the Convention about the length of the proceedings. The second applicant complained of a violation of Articles 14 and 17 of the Convention on account of the outcome of the proceedings.", "44.  Having carefully examined the applicants' remaining complaints under Articles 6, 13, 14 and 17 of the Convention in the light of all the material in its possession and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention and must be dismissed pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.", "V.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "45.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "46.  The first applicant claimed 10,000 euros (EUR) in respect of nonpecuniary damage. The second applicant claimed EUR 3,398,400 in respect of pecuniary damage and EUR 10,000,000 for non-pecuniary damage.", "47.  The Government contested the applicants' claims.", "48.  The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged by the second applicant; it therefore rejects the claim. On the other hand, ruling on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, it awards each of the applicants EUR 2,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "49.  The first applicant also claimed 2,450 Ukrainian hryvnias for legal costs incurred before the Court.", "50.  The Government submitted that the claimed amount had not been calculated in accordance with relevant domestic rules and that it was excessive, given the subject-matter of the case.", "51.  According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 226 claimed in respect of the first applicant's legal costs.", "52.  The second applicant made no claim as to costs and expenses. Therefore, the Court makes no award to him under this head.", "C.  Default interest", "53.  The Court considers it appropriate that default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Decides to join the applications;", "", "2.  Decides to join to the merits the Government's objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies, based on the argument that the applicants had failed to request the renewal of the term for lodging an appeal in cassation, and rejects it;", "", "3.  Declares the applicants' complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention of lack of access to court admissible and the remainder of the applications inadmissible;", "", "4.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;", "", "5.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, each of the applicants EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, and the first applicant EUR 226 (two hundred and twenty-six euros) for costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants on the above amounts;", "(b)  that the above amounts be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;", "(b)  that, from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement, simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "6.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicants' claims for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 21 December 2010, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tClaudia Westerdiek\tPeer Lorenzen\n\tRegistrar\tPresident"]}
