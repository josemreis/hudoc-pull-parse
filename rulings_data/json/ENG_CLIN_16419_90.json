however, when examining the applicants' complaints, it would take account of the state of the proceedings at the time when the above-mentioned declaration had been deposited.", "From 22 January 1990 onwards all the State's acts and omissions not only had to conform to the Convention but were also undoubtedly subject to review by the Convention institutions.", "Conclusion: objection dismissed (unanimously).", "2.\tNon-exhaustion of domestic remedies", "First limb of objection: in 1958 the Court of Cassation had twice held that Article 299 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which was designed to enable applications to be made to have detention orders set aside, did not apply to orders prolonging detention.", "Second limb: the Government had not disputed that Article 19 of the Constitution was largely modelled on Article 5 of the Convention and that the latter had been relied on by the applicants in the National Security Court three times.", "Third limb: Law no. 466 referred to an action for damages against the State in respect of detention undergone by persons who had been acquitted, whereas applicants had complained of the length of their detention pending trial.", "Conclusion: objection dismissed (unanimously).", "3.\tLoss of victim status", "Objection that applicants had received a kind of redress for allegedly excessive length of their detention and the proceedings: had not been raised before Commission and there was estoppel.", "Conclusion: objection dismissed (unanimously).", "III.\tARTICLE 5 § 3 OF THE CONVENTION", "A.\tPeriod to be taken into consideration", "Starting-point: depositing of Turkey's declaration.", "End: applicants' provisional release.", "Result: three months and thirteen days, but fact had to be taken into account that by critical date applicants had been in custody for two years and two months.", "B.\tReasonableness of length of detention", "Recapitulation of Court's case-law.", "Danger of absconding: applicants had returned to Turkey of their own accord and with specific aim of founding Turkish United Communist Party - they could not have been unaware that they would be prosecuted for that - National Security Court's orders had confirmed the detention without in any way explaining why there was a danger of absconding.", "Expression \"the state of the evidence\": could be understood to mean the existence and persistence of serious indications of guilt - in the instant case those circumstances could not on their own justify continuation of detention.", "Date of arrest: that reason did not stand up to scrutiny either, since no total period of detention was justified in itself, without there being relevant grounds under the Convention.", "Conclusion: violation (eight votes to one).", "IV.\tARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION", "A.\tPeriod to be taken into consideration", "Starting-point: depositing of Turkey's declaration.", "End: date on which the Ankara Second Assize Court's judgment became final.", "Result: two years, five months and eighteen days, but fact had to be taken into account that by critical date the proceedings had already lasted more than two years.", "B.\tReasonableness of length of proceedings", "To be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, regard being had to the criteria laid down in the Court's case-law.", "1.\tComplexity of case", "Twenty hearings held by National Security Court, sixteen of which were devoted almost entirely to reading out evidence -
