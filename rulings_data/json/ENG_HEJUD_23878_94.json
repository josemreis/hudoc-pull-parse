At that time they were members of the People’s Labour Party (Halkın Emeği Partisi), which was founded in June 1990 but proscribed and dissolved by the Constitutional Court on 14 August 1993 on account of what were held to be separatist activities. By that date the applicants had joined the Democracy Party (Demokrasi Partisi), which had been set up in the meantime.", "7.  On 2 March 1994 the National Assembly lifted their parliamentary immunity on an application, first lodged in November 1992 and subsequently resubmitted on several occasions, by the public prosecutor attached to the Ankara National Security Court (Ankara Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi Cumhuriyet savcısı – “the public prosecutor”). He accused them of committing the offences defined in Article 125 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 20 below), which were classified as terrorist crimes in the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 – see paragraph 21 below) and thus came within the jurisdiction of the national security courts (see paragraph 22 below).", "8.  On the same day, as they were leaving the parliament building, Mr Dicle and Mr Doğan were arrested on the public prosecutor’s orders and taken into police custody at the headquarters of the anti-terrorist section of the Ankara security police. On the following day their lawyers asked for their clients to be brought promptly before a judge and asked the public\nprosecutor for permission to speak to them. The written authorisation issued by the public prosecutor for that purpose specified that the interview – to be conducted under supervision – was to concern preparation of the appeal the applicants were intending to lodge against the lifting of their parliamentary immunity.", "9.  The other four applicants had refused to leave the parliament precinct, but on 4 March they suffered the same fate as their two colleagues. ", "On that day the public prosecutor extended the six applicants’ detention in police custody until 16 March 1994 on the ground that further investigations were needed; his decision was based on section 30 of Law no. 3842 governing procedure before the national security courts (see paragraph 23 below). While in police custody the applicants refused to make any statement.", "10.  On 11 March the lawyer acting for Mr Dicle and Mr Doğan, referring to his request of 3 March that they be brought promptly before a judge (see paragraph 8 above), made another application to the same effect, relying on Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention, inter alia.", "11.  On 21 March 1994 the Constitutional Court dismissed appeals lodged by the applicants against the lifting of their parliamentary immunity.", "B.\t\tDetention pending trial", "12.  In the meantime, on 17 March 1994, a single judge of the National Security Court had issued an order for the MPs’ detention pending trial, giving as the reasons the “character and nature” of the offence concerned and the “evidence obtained”.", "13.  On appeal by the applicants, a bench of three judges of the same court upheld the above order on 22 March 1994, holding that it was necessary “on account of the classification and nature of the offences [concerned], the charges already preferred, the length of [the applicants’] detention and the fact that the case [was] still at the investigation stage”.", "14.  On 12 April the applicants lodged a further application for release, which was dismissed by the National Security Court on 13 May on the ground that the case was “still at the investigation stage” and that to date there had been “no change in the detained MPs’ favour”.", "C.\tTrial in the Ankara National Security Court", "15.  On 21 June 1994 the public prosecutor filed submissions accusing the applicants of separatism and undermining the integrity of the State, which are capital offences under Article 125 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 7 above and 20 below).", "\n16.  On 8 December 1994 the National Security Court delivered its judgment.

The facts of the case constituted only the prolongation of a terrorist campaign being conducted from inside the area where the state of emergency had been proclaimed, in south-east Turkey. The terrorist threat was not confined to any particular part of Turkish territory. That had to be taken into account if the Turkish derogation was to be interpreted in the light of its object and purpose, namely to enable “normality for the purposes of the Convention” to be restored throughout the country as quickly as possible.", "38.  In its Aksoy v. Turkey judgment the Court has already noted the unquestionably serious problem of terrorism in south-east Turkey and the difficulties faced by the State in taking effective measures against it. It held in that connection that the particular extent and impact of Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK) activity in south-east Turkey had undoubtedly created, in the region concerned, a “public emergency threatening the life of the nation” (see the judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, pp. 2281 and 2284, §§ 70 and 84).", "39.  It should be noted, however, that Article 15 authorises derogations from the obligations arising from the Convention only “to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation”.", "In the present case the Court would be working against the object and purpose of that provision if, when assessing the territorial scope of the derogation concerned, it were to extend its effects to a part of Turkish territory not explicitly named in the notice of derogation. It follows that the derogation in question is inapplicable ratione loci to the facts of the case.", "Consequently, it is not necessary to determine whether it satisfies the requirements of Article 15.", "B.\t\tArticle 5 § 1 of the Convention", "40.  Before the Commission the applicants maintained that their arrest had been in breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. In their memorial to the Court, however, they accepted the Commission’s conclusion that this provision had not been breached (see paragraph 30 above). Consequently, they presented no argument regarding this complaint. The Court likewise considers that no breach of Article 5 § 1 has been established.", "C.\tArticle 5 § 3 of the Convention", "41.  The applicants alleged that, contrary to Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, they had not been brought “promptly” before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power.", "The Commission accepted this argument in substance.", "42.  The Government pleaded the nature and scale of the terrorist threat in Turkey and the particular difficulties encountered in taking action to ward off that threat, which was incomparably more serious and more imminent than the threat posed by other examples of terrorism in Europe.", "In the instant case the public prosecutor had for some considerable time been in possession of information confirming the suspicions of collusion between the applicants and the PKK, but the evidence – twenty-two ring-binders’ full in all – still had to be obtained. That was why it had been necessary to hold the applicants in police custody. Moreover, if they had not chosen to remain silent, thus deliberately adding obstacles to those already encountered by the investigators, they might have been able to cut their detention short.", "43.  The applicants submitted that the conduct held against them, namely dissemination of what were deemed to be separatist views, did not constitute “terrorism”. Furthermore, since the authorities had originally applied for the lifting of their parliamentary immunity in November 1992, they must already have been in possession at that time of the evidence necessary to prosecute them.", "44.  The Court has already accepted on several occasions that the investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems (see the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, p. 33, § 61, the Murray v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300-A, p. 27, § 58, and the above-mentioned Aksoy judgment, p. 2282, § 78). This does not mean, however, that the investigating authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 to arrest suspects for questioning, free from effective control by the domestic courts and, ultimately, by the Convention supervisory institutions, whenever they choose to assert that terrorism is involved (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Murray judgment, p. 27, § 58).", "What is at stake here is the importance of Article 5 in the Convention system: it enshrines a fundamental human right, namely the protection of the individual against arbitrary interferences by the State with his right to liberty. Judicial control of interferences by the executive is an essential feature of the guarantee embodied in Article 5 § 3, which is intended to minimise the risk of arbitrariness and to secure the rule of law, “one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society …, which is expressly referred to in the Preamble to the Convention” (see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, p. 32, § 58, and the above-mentioned Aksoy judgment, p. 2282, § 76).", "\n45.  The Court notes that the applicants’ detention in police custody lasted twelve days in the case of Mr Sakık, Mr Türk, Mr Alınak and Mrs Zana, and fourteen days in the case of Mr Dicle and Mr Doğan.", "It recalls that in the Brogan case it held that detention in police custody which had lasted four days and six hours without judicial control fell outside the strict constraints as to time laid down by Article 5 § 3, even though its purpose was to protect the community as a whole against terrorism (see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, p. 33, § 62).", "Even supposing that the activities of which the applicants stood accused were linked to a terrorist threat, the Court cannot accept that it was necessary to detain them for twelve or fourteen days without judicial intervention.", "46.  Accordingly, there has been a breach of Article 5 § 3.", "D.\tArticle 5 § 4 of the Convention", "1.\tThe Government’s preliminary objection", "47.  The Government raised a preliminary objection on the ground of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. They contended that the applicants had failed to invoke in the national courts, in addition to Article 19 § 8 of the Constitution (see paragraph 18 above), Article 5 § 4 of the Convention itself, which, pursuant to Article 90 § 5 of the Constitution (see paragraph 19 above), has the force of law in Turkey.", "48.  The Court notes that this preliminary objection was not raised before the Commission. It is therefore inadmissible on grounds of estoppel (see, among other authorities, the Ceteroni v. Italy judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, pp. 1755–56, § 19).", "2.\tMerits of the complaint", "49.  The applicants complained that they had not been able to take proceedings to have the lawfulness of the public prosecutor’s decisions ordering their detention in police custody decided by a judge. The Commission accepted this argument.", "50.  The Government submitted that the review required by Article 5 § 4 of the Convention was carried out by the single judge who ordered the applicants’ detention pending trial (see paragraph 12 above).", "51.  The Court notes that, irrespective of whether, when ordering the applicants’ detention pending trial, the single judge also ruled on the lawfulness of their detention in police custody, that judge did not intervene until the end of the latter, that is to say twelve days, or fourteen days in some cases, after their arrest. Having regard to the conclusion it reached \nwith regard to Article 5 § 3 (see paragraph 46 above), the Court considers that such a lengthy period sits ill with the notion of “speedily” (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium judgment of 24 June 1982, Series A no. 50, p. 29, § 53).", "52.  The Government further maintained that Article 19 § 8 of the Constitution (see paragraph 18 above) provided a remedy which was also available before national security courts. Its wording was almost identical to that of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, which was itself directly applicable in Turkish law, pursuant to Article 90 § 5 of the Constitution (see paragraph 19 above).", "53.  The Court reiterates that the existence of a remedy must be sufficiently certain, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of Article 5 § 4 (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Van Droogenbroeck judgment, p. 30, § 54, the De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p. 19, § 39, and the Yağcı and Sargın v. Turkey judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319-A, p. 17, § 42).", "However, the file supplied to the Court contains no example of any person detained in police custody having successfully invoked Article 19 § 8 of the Constitution or Article 5 § 4 of the Convention when applying to a judge for a ruling on the lawfulness of his detention or for his release. The Court does not consider itself to be required to determine this question of Turkish law. However, the lack of precedents indicates the uncertainty of this remedy in practice (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Van Droogenbroeck judgment, p. 31, § 55, and the above-mentioned De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink judgment, p. 19, § 39).", "54.  In conclusion, there has been a breach of Article 5 § 4.", "E.\t\tArticle 5 § 5 of the Convention", "1.\tThe Government’s preliminary objection", "55.  The Government raised a preliminary objection in which they pleaded non-exhaustion of domestic remedies on two grounds. Firstly, the applicants had omitted to rely in the domestic courts on Articles 19 § 9 and 90 § 5 of the Constitution read in conjunction with each other (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above). Secondly, they should have sought a remedy under Law no. 466 of 7 May 1964, which guarantees the possibility of an award of damages to any person who has been unlawfully deprived of his liberty, or who, after being lawfully detained, is not subsequently committed for trial or is acquitted or discharged after standing trial (see paragraph 24 above).", "56.  The Court notes that the first limb of this preliminary objection was not raised before the Commission. It is therefore inadmissible on grounds of estoppel (see paragraph 48 above).", "57.  It also considers that the second limb is closely linked to consideration of the complaint under Article 5 § 5. It therefore joins it to the merits (see paragraphs 60 and 61 below).", "2.\tMerits of the complaint", "58.  Lastly, the applicants alleged that, in breach of Article 5 § 5, under Turkish law it was not possible for them to claim compensation for a violation of Article 5 in the domestic courts.", "59.  The Government asserted that this would indeed have been possible if there had been any such violation, which was not the case. The applicants could have relied on the last paragraph of Article 19 of the Constitution, whose wording had been modelled on Article 5 § 5 of the Convention, which was itself directly applicable in the Turkish legal system, pursuant to Article 90 § 5 of the Constitution (see paragraph 19 above). Furthermore, they could have relied, as a lex specialis, on section 1 of Law no. 466 on the payment of compensation to persons unlawfully arrested or detained (see paragraph 24 above). As they had not availed themselves of either of these possibilities, the applicants were not entitled to complain of a breach of paragraph 5.", "60.  As in connection with Article 5 § 4 (see paragraph 53 above), the Court notes that there is no example in the case file of any litigant obtaining the compensation referred to in Article 5 § 5 by relying on one of the provisions mentioned by the Government.", "With particular reference to section 1 of Law no. 466, the Court notes, like the Commission and the applicants, that with the exception of the situation – which did not obtain in the instant case – where a person is not committed for trial, or is acquitted or discharged after standing trial (subsection 6), all the cases in which compensation is payable under the provision concerned require the deprivation of liberty to have been unlawful. But the detention in issue was in accordance with Turkish law, as the Government conceded.", "In conclusion, effective enjoyment of the right guaranteed by Article 5 § 5 of the Convention is not ensured with a sufficient degree of certainty (see, mutatis mutandis, the Ciulla v. Italy judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 148, p. 18, § 44).", "61.  Consequently, the Court dismisses the second limb of the Government’s preliminary objection and concludes that there has been a breach of Article 5 § 5.", "II.\tAPPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION", "62.  Under Article 50 of the Convention:", "“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.\tNon-pecuniary damage", "63.  The applicants claimed compensation for the non-pecuniary damage resulting from the deprivation of their liberty, which, they asserted, had been aggravated by the damage to their “reputations as members of parliament”. They each claimed 600,000 French francs (FRF) for prejudice suffered in their “private capacity” and the same amount for “damage to their reputations as members of parliament”.", "64.  The Government submitted that, if the Court were to find a violation, the judgment would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 50.", "They argued that the applicants’ claims were based on concepts which had nothing to do with the Court’s case-law and were neither justified nor founded, since there was no proof of any causal connection between the length of their detention in police custody and the non-pecuniary damage they had alleged. If there had been any damage to the applicants’ “reputations as members of parliament”, this had been caused not by their detention in police custody but by the lifting of their parliamentary immunity by the Turkish National Assembly.", "65.  The Delegate of the Commission submitted that compensation should be awarded, but considered the sum claimed excessive.", "66.  The Court notes that the applicants were detained in police custody for twelve days (Mr Sakık, Mr Türk, Mr Alınak and Mrs Zana) or fourteen days (Mr Dicle and Mr Doğan) without judicial intervention. It is in no doubt that the circumstances in which they were deprived of their liberty must have caused them non-pecuniary damage for which the domestic courts have not awarded them any compensation.", "Taking into account the various aspects of the case and making an assessment on an equitable basis, as required by Article 50, the Court awards FRF 25,000 each to Mr Sakık, Mr Türk, Mr Alınak and Mrs Zana and FRF 30,000 each to Mr Dicle and Mr Doğan. These sums are to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable on the date of settlement.", "B.\t\tCosts and expenses", "67.  In respect of their costs and expenses for representation before the Turkish authorities and later before the Convention institutions, the applicants claimed FRF 344,546.", "68.  The Government considered that sum exorbitant and unjustified, in particular because it included the cost of numerous group journeys between Paris and Ankara and was based on an hourly rate which bore no comparison with the normal rate in Turkey.", "69.  The Delegate of the Commission left the matter to the Court’s discretion.", "70.  Making an assessment on an equitable basis and according to the criteria laid down in its case-law (see, among other authorities, the Nideröst-Huber v. Switzerland judgment of 18 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, p. 110, § 40), the Court awards the applicants FRF 120,000 under this head.", "C.\tDefault interest", "71.  The Court deems it appropriate to adopt the statutory rate applicable in France on the date of adoption of the present judgment, that is 3.87% per annum.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.\tHolds that the derogation made by Turkey under Article 15 of the Convention is not applicable in the case;", "2.\tHolds that there has been no breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention;", "3.\tHolds that there has been a breach of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention;", "4.\tDismisses the Government’s preliminary objection relating to Article 5 § 4 of the Convention;", "5.\tHolds that there has been a breach of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention;", "6.\tDismisses both limbs of the Government’s preliminary objection relating to Article 5 § 5 of the Convention, the second of which it joined to and considered with the merits;", "7.\tHolds that there has been a breach of Article 5 § 5 of the Convention;", "8.\tHolds", "(a) that the respondent State is to pay, within three months, the following sums:", "\n(i) for non-pecuniary damage, 25,000 (twenty-five thousand) French francs each to Mr Sakık, Mr Türk, Mr Alınak and Mrs Zana and 30,000 (thirty thousand) French francs each to Mr Dicle and Mr Doğan, which sums are to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable on the date of settlement;", "\t(ii) for costs and expenses, 120,000 (one hundred and twenty thousand) French francs to the applicants;", "(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 3.87% shall be payable on these amounts from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;", "9.\tDismisses the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 26 November 1997.", "", "", "", "", "Signed: Rudolf Bernhardt", "\tPresident", "Signed: Herbert Petzold", "\tRegistrar"]}
