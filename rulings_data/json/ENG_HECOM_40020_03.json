They remained there several days, during which time they were not offered work. After a while, X. declared to the second applicant that Y., his nephew, wanted to marry her daughter (the first applicant). As the second and the third applicants refused, X. threatened them with a loaded gun. Then, the second and the third applicants were beaten, threatened with death and forced to leave the first applicant in Italy and go back to .

She made allegations that showed a number of discrepancies, compared with the complaint already submitted by her mother, and which led the authorities to conclude that no kidnapping, but an agreement about a marriage, had in reality taken place between the two families. This conclusion was confirmed by some photographs given to the police after the raid by X., apparently showing a wedding party at which the second applicant received a sum of money from X. When showed the photographs, the first applicant denied that her father had taken money as part of the agreement about the marriage.", "19.  At 8.30 p.m. the third applicant was questioned by the Public Prosecutor in .
