It originated in an application (no. 28213/95) against the French Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under Article 25 by a French national, Mr I.A., on 29 March 1993. The applicant asked the Court not to reveal his identity.", "The Government’s application referred to Article 48 of the Convention. The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.", "2.  In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated as the lawyer who would represent him Mr T. Fillion, of the Rennes Bar (Rule 30).", "3.  The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr L.-E. Pettiti, the elected judge of French nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On 31 January 1998, in the presence of the Registrar, the Vice-President of the Court, Mr R. Bernhardt, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr R. Macdonald, Mr J. De Meyer, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr A.B. Baka and Mr E. Levits (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5). Subsequently Mr Ryssdal, who died on 18 February 1998, was replaced as President of the Chamber by Mr Bernhardt (Rule 21 § 6, second sub-paragraph).", "4.  As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, had consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 § 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s and the Government’s memorials on 20 and 25 May 1998 respectively. On 2 June 1998 the Secretary to the Commission indicated that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.", "5.  By a letter of 19 June 1998 Mr Fillion informed Mr Bernhardt that he would be replaced at the hearing by Ms M.

In December 1990 he travelled to Lebanon, where he married a young Lebanese woman, who became his second wife.", "A.\tBackground to the case", "8.  On 21 June 1991 the body of a young woman was retrieved from the harbour mouth at Les Sables d’Olonne (Vendée). She had been gagged, her teeth had been broken and she had head wounds. The body bore the marks of strangulation, had burns on the chest and thighs and had been weighted down with a weight of about twenty kilograms. A post-mortem carried out the same day by Drs Nadau and Rocard revealed, inter alia, that the cause of death had been asphyxia and that the victim had received a blow to the head before she died.", "9.  On 25 June 1991 a murder inquiry was opened and the investigating judge ordered an expert report on the body. The report, by a Professor Rudler, was filed on 29 October 1991.", "10.  Having been unable to identify the body, the investigators circulated this information through Interpol. On 5 November 1991 the Interpol office in Beirut informed them that the applicant’s wife’s parents, who were worried because they had had no recent news of their daughter, had reported her disappearance to the Lebanese authorities.", "\nIt was subsequently discovered that, by letters of 21 August 1991, the applicant had reported his wife’s disappearance to the municipal services of Nuaille (Maine-et-Loire) and the Vezins gendarmerie. When he was interviewed on 14 September 1991 by gendarmes belonging to that brigade he had stated that his wife had left him on 18 June 1991 to join her brother in Switzerland, taking with her some money and objects of value that she had stolen from him. On 4 October 1991 he had also filed a missing person report with the prefectoral authorities.", "11.  Tests carried out on the body identified the victim as the applicant’s wife.", "12.  The applicant was taken into police custody on 4 December 1991. When interviewed by the police conducting the inquiry he first asserted that on 18 June 1991 he had dropped his wife off at Angers station, where she had caught a train to Paris before travelling to Switzerland.", "He subsequently made, in substance, the following statement: on 19 June 1991, after a domestic quarrel, the applicant’s wife had attempted to take her own life by swallowing medicines and then dousing herself with household bleach, after which she had hanged herself with a clothes line; fearing the reactions of his wife’s family, Mr I.A. had cut down her body, pushed her tongue back into her mouth with a piece of cloth, wrapped the body in a sheet and blanket, tied and weighted it and then placed it in the boot of his car before driving to Les Sables d’Olonne, where, next day, after waiting for nightfall, he had thrown it into the sea.", "As the investigation proceeded, it revealed the inconsistencies of this version of events. For example, the applicant’s wife had not doused herself with bleach nor had she swallowed medicines; she had not been hanged but strangled; and it was before she died that the piece of cloth had been placed in her mouth and the burns found on her body and the injuries to her teeth had been caused.", "B.\t\tThe judicial investigation", "1.  The course of the investigation during 1991", "13.  On 6 December 1991 the Sables d’Olonne investigating judge charged Mr I.A. with murder and made a provisional order for his \nimprisonment, committing him to prison for three days. On 9 December 1991 the judge made an order for his detention on remand worded as follows:", "“…", "Whereas the constraints of judicial supervision are inadequate with regard to the functions set out in Article 137 of the Code of Criminal Procedure;", "Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is necessary", "to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence,", "to protect the accused, ", "and to ensure that the accused remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities,", "in that, as the case concerns a serious crime, and in the light of what the investigations conducted hitherto have revealed, public order has been disturbed, in particular by the circumstances of the discovery of the body;", "in that the accused belongs to a Lebanese community, so that he must be protected from the risk of revenge attacks by the victim’s family;", "and in that there is a need to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities, as he may abscond to the Middle East at any time.”", "14.  On 10 December 1991 the investigating judge appointed a Professor Pannier and a Dr Bureau to produce an expert report on the lesions found on the victim’s body (their report was filed on 3 June 1992).", "On the same day, and again on 16 December 1991, the judge interviewed one of the applicant’s cousins, who had come to see him of his own accord.", "15.  On 19 December 1991 the investigating judge appointed a Professor Doutremepuich to produce an expert report on vaginal and anal swabs taken from the victim.", "16.  On 20 December 1991 the investigating judge held a reconstruction of the crime, which was attended, among others, by the doctor who had performed the post-mortem, who was appointed expert with the special task of verifying the compatibility of the versions of events given by the accused with the results of the post-mortem (his report was filed on 10 January 1992).", "On the same day the investigating judge questioned Mr I.A.", "17.  From 20 December 1991 to 12 February 1992, acting on instructions received on 18 December 1991, the Angers Regional Criminal Investigation Department (SRPJ) monitored the telephone line of a Mr V. and a Miss B., two of the applicant’s acquaintances.", "2.  The course of the investigation in 1992", "18.  On 7 January 1992 the investigating judge appointed Professor Doutremepuich to examine the rag that had been used to gag the applicant’s wife. On 8 January he appointed two psychologists, a Mrs Griffon and a Mr Troadec, to produce medico-psychological reports on the applicant and a Dr Pennec to produce a psychiatric report (the reports of the first two experts mentioned were filed on 2 April 1992, that of the third expert on 8 April 1992).", "19.  On 16 January 1992, acting on instructions received on 6 December 1991, a detective from the Angers SRPJ interviewed the applicant’s first wife.", "20.  The investigating judge took evidence from Mr I.A.’s cousin as a civil party on 29 January 1992. On 12 February he took evidence from the victim’s brother and sister-in-law – they had previously been interviewed on 5 February by the Angers SRPJ, acting on instructions of 20 December 1991; on 14 February and 6 March 1992 he confronted them with the applicant.", "21.  On 18 March 1992, acting on instructions of 6 March, the Angers SRPJ took a sample of hair from the body.", "22.  On 18 and 20 March 1992, acting on instructions of 20 December 1991, the Angers SRPJ took statements from Mr V. and Miss B., and from a woman with whom Mr I.A. had been carrying on a sexual relationship before his arrest. The latter declared in particular that the applicant had informed her of his intention of leaving France for Australia as soon as his house was sold.", "23.  On 31 March 1992 the investigating judge visited the scene of the crime.", "On 15 April 1992 he again interviewed the applicant’s cousin.", "On 30 April 1992 he took a statement from the applicant’s ex-wife.", "24.  On 21 May 1992 the investigating judge confronted the applicant’s cousin with Mr V. and Miss B., then interviewed Mr I.A., asking him in particular whether he wanted any special expert examinations of the victim’s body to be made. On the basis of instructions given the same day, Mr V. and Miss B. were again interviewed by the Angers SRPJ.", "On 26 May the investigating judge held a confrontation with the victim’s brother and sister-in-law.", "25.  On 29 May 1992 the judge refused an application for release lodged by Mr I.A. in an order worded as follows:", "“…", "Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is necessary", "to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence,", "to protect the accused,", "and to ensure that the accused remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities,", "in that the offence gravely disturbed public order, being a serious crime; in that further inquiries are necessary; and in that it is necessary to ensure that the accused remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities on account of the fact that, being a Lebanese national, he is likely to flee the jurisdiction, a step which it seems he considered taking shortly before his arrest.”", "On appeal by the applicant, the Indictment Division of the Poitiers Court of Appeal upheld the above order in a judgment of 16 June 1992, on the following grounds:", "“Having regard to the penalty to which the accused would be liable if found guilty and the fact that he has family ties in Lebanon, it is to be feared that he might seek to evade justice by absconding to that country. It is obviously necessary to continue his detention to prevent him from doing so.”", "26.  On 10 June 1992 the investigating judge held a confrontation between the applicant and the three people he had interviewed on 21 May.", "27.  On the basis of instructions given on 17 June 1992, a witness was interviewed by the Angers SRPJ.", "28.  On 10 July 1992 the investigating judge confronted Mr I.A.’s cousin with his ex-wife.", "29.  On 14 September 1992 the investigating judge refused an application for release lodged by Mr I.A. on 9 September in an order worded as follows:", "“Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is the only way", "to preserve the evidence,", "and to prevent pressure being brought to bear on witnesses or the victim,", "in that the accused has shown particular duplicity in the organisation of his lies; in that he has colluded with third parties (ex-wife and friend); and in that new evidence has turned up during the investigation (discovery of allegedly stolen jewellery);", "Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is necessary", "to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence,", "to protect the accused,", "and to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities,", "\nin that public order has been disturbed in the extreme on account of the international, family implications to which the accused himself refers in his application; and in that the accused himself admits to living in fear ‘of our frequently barbaric and unjust customs’, his continued detention is the only way to ensure his protection and to avoid all risk of his absconding in the event of his release.”", "30.  On 16 October 1992 the accused was served with a copy of the expert report of Professor Pannier and Dr Bureau and was informed that he had fifteen days to submit observations or request an additional expert report or second opinion; he was then interviewed by the investigating judge.", "He was again questioned by the investigating judge on 28 October 1992.", "31.  By an order of 29 October 1992 the investigating judge appointed an expert to carry out “an inquiry into the accused’s personality, his financial circumstances, and his family and social background, and to provide any kind of information about his pattern of behaviour”. The report was filed on 14 January 1993.", "32.  By an order of 17 November 1992, which reproduced the wording of the order of 14 September 1992, the investigating judge refused an application for release lodged by the applicant.", "33.  On 25 November 1992 the investigating judge interviewed the applicant’s cousin.", "34.  On 4 December 1992 the judge extended for one year the applicant’s detention on remand, by means of the following order:", "“Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is the only way to prevent collusion between him and his accomplices,", "in that the circumstances of the victim’s death and the barbaric acts which she suffered remain obscure; in that it is necessary to try to ascertain the accused’s motives, in case this was not just a simple private problem but formed part of a much more general context with Lebanese links; and in that it is therefore possible that the accused did not act alone;", "Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is necessary", "to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence,", "to protect the accused,", "and to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities,", "in that the case file shows that there is a very serious risk of reprisals; in that the very special circumstances of the victim’s death (barbarity) have been partly responsible for a lasting disturbance of public opinion; and in that it is necessary, in view of the penalty to which the accused is liable, and his foreign origin, to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities.”", "\n35.  On 8 December 1992 the investigating judge visited the scene of the crime.", "3.  The course of the investigation in 1993", "36.  On 13 January 1993 the investigating judge refused another application for release from the applicant, by an order drafted in the same terms as the order of 4 December 1992 (the only major difference being that it omitted to mention that detention was necessary for the protection of the accused). He also refused, on 5 March 1993, an application submitted on 2 March, on the ground that detention was the only way to prevent pressure being brought to bear on witnesses and was necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused and to ensure that he remained at the disposal of the judicial authorities.", "37.  On 16 March 1993 the investigating judge asked a Dr Lavault to produce an additional expert report to verify whether the burns found on the victim’s body had been caused before death.", "On 24 March 1993 he served Mr I.A. with the conclusions of the expert report on the rag that had been used to gag the victim, informed him that he had fifteen days to submit observations or request an additional expert report or second opinion and then interviewed him.", "38.  By an order of 2 April 1993 the investigating judge refused a new application for release lodged by the applicant on the ground that detention was necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused and to ensure that he remained at the disposal of the judicial authorities. More specifically, the order stated:", "“Whereas the offence seriously disturbed public order, since it involved the death of a young woman in particularly barbaric circumstances; and whereas this disturbance, which extends beyond French territory, both the victim and the offender being of Lebanese origin, has not ceased to this day;", "Whereas it is necessary to keep at the disposal of the judicial authorities a person whose life would be endangered by his release, given the indignation and distress that such a measure could not fail to provoke among the victim’s relatives, as they would not be able to understand or accept it, although they have hitherto placed their trust in French justice;", "And whereas, lastly, the investigation will in all probability be concluded when the inquiries currently in progress have been completed, and the transmission of the file to the public prosecutor’s office can be expected to take place by the end of June.”", "\nOn appeal by Mr I.A., the Indictment Division of the Poitiers Court of Appeal upheld this order in a judgment of 21 April, on the following grounds:", "“Having regard to the penalty to which the accused would be liable if found guilty and the fact that he has family ties in Lebanon, it is to be feared that he might seek to evade justice by absconding to that country.

These orders generally stated that Mr I.A.’s detention was the only way to prevent pressure being brought to bear on witnesses and was necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused and to ensure that he remained at the disposal of the judicial authorities.

They argued on that basis that the detention in issue had lasted five years, three months and thirteen days.", "In its report of 10 September 1997, the Commission also took 20 March 1997 as the relevant date. Nevertheless, at the hearing before the Court, the Delegate of the Commission expressed the opinion that the retrospective effect of the annulment of the Maine-et-Loire Assize Court’s judgment by the Court of Cassation on 1 April 1998 should be taken into account. According to domestic law, the conviction was deemed never to have taken place, so that the applicant’s detention on remand had not been interrupted. That approach was moreover apparent from the reasoning of the judgment delivered by the Indictment Division of the Rennes Court of Appeal on 28 May 1998.", "98.  The Court reiterates that in principle conviction by a court marks the end of the period to be considered under Article 5 § 3; from that point on, the detention of the person concerned falls within the scope of Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention (see, for example, the B. v. Austria judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A no. 175, p. 14, § 36).", "In the present case the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment by a judgment of the Maine-et-Loire Assize Court of 20 March 1997 (see paragraph 79 above). That was the reason for his detention between the latter date and 1 April 1998, when the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation quashed and annulled his conviction; during that period he was obviously detained “after conviction by a competent court” not “for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority”. Accordingly, notwithstanding the retrospective effect in French law of the judgment annulling his conviction, the period to be considered under Article 5 § 3 ended on 20 March 1997.", "As to the new period of detention on remand, which began after 10 September 1997, the date of adoption of the Commission’s report, and consequently was not the object of a complaint examined by the Commission, the Court considers that it should not be taken into account (see the Kemmache v. France (nos. 1 and 2) judgment of 27 November 1991, Series A no. 218, p. 23, § 44).", "In short, the period of detention that the Court must now consider lasted just over five years and three months.", "B.\t\tReasonableness of the length of detention", "1.  Arguments of those appearing before the Court", "99.  Mr I.A. submitted that the length of his detention on remand could not be held to be justified under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.", "There was no risk of collusion or of a repetition of the offence because the authorities were not looking for any accomplice or co-principal and he had no previous convictions. Nor could the fact that he denied killing his wife justify his continued detention, since that attitude was purely and simply the expression of the system of defence he had chosen. Moreover, in view of the offence he had been charged with and the lack of any real international dimension to the case, it could not be described as complex. Lastly, it had been legitimate for him to make use of the remedies available to him under French law.", "The truth was that the investigating judges themselves had slowed down the progress of the investigation considerably by systematically trying to obtain a confession. That was the reason for the length of his detention on remand.", "100.  The Government agreed that the period of detention on remand undergone by the applicant had been lengthy, but argued that the length was justified by the “very special circumstances of the case”.", "The persistence of reasons to suspect the applicant during the period under consideration was not in doubt. The other grounds cited by the competent courts had been relevant and sufficient.", "The nature and circumstances of the crime concerned, the accused’s attitude in the weeks that followed the crime and during the investigation, and the international dimension of the case – which had caused quite a stir in Lebanon – had all contributed to a serious and lasting disturbance of public order which release of the applicant would have exacerbated.", "In addition, according to the Government, on account of Mr I.A.’s personality and conduct the investigating judge could legitimately fear that once released he would attempt to impede discovery of the truth by bringing pressure to bear on witnesses and contacting any accomplices he might have had. Besides, he had lied to those around him and hidden or destroyed evidence, notably by instigating from his prison cell the theft of documents he considered compromising and the destruction of the vehicle that had been used to move the body. The fear that pressure would be brought to bear on witnesses had remained relevant after 7 December 1993 and until the hearing before the Assize Court, as was evidenced by the fact that the investigators had interviewed witnesses after that date on instructions from the investigating judge and the fact that on 31 May 1995 the investigating judge had confronted the accused with the people who had carried out the robbery mentioned above. In short, the requirements of the investigation had pleaded in favour of keeping the applicant detained.", "\nFurthermore, various evidence indicated that there was a serious risk that, if released, Mr I.A. would abscond: firstly, in their statements of 16 January and 20 March 1992, his ex-wife and his mistress had mentioned his intention of leaving France; secondly, at the time of his arrest, he had been trying to sell his house. The competent judges had looked into the question of substituting judicial supervision for detention on remand and had noted the inadequacy of the other guarantees provided for under French law to ensure that a defendant appears in court to stand trial. In any event, in view of the applicant’s modest income, his release on payment of a security would not have been conceivable.", "In short, the circumstances of the case justified the fact that the applicant had not been released during the proceedings. As for the length of his detention on remand, this had been mainly due to his conduct: by refusing to cooperate with the investigators and by lodging numerous applications and appeals, he had played a large part in slowing down the progress of the investigation, thereby putting off the date of his trial. On the other hand, the conduct of the judicial authorities in that respect had been irreproachable.", "101.  The Commission considered that the seriousness of the offence the applicant stood accused of and the persistence of reasons to suspect him, even though these subsequently proved to be well-founded, were not in themselves sufficient to justify the length of the detention in issue.", "It acknowledged that Mr I.A.’s lack of cooperation had made necessary a great deal of detailed investigative work and that the case was relatively complex, but went on to say that these were not the main reasons for the length of the period concerned.", "It was not convinced that a risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses persisted after 7 December 1993, when the investigating judge took the last statement from a witness. As to the danger of collusion, although this had been a very real risk at the beginning of the investigation, it had gradually diminished.", "In addition, the Commission considered that the risk of the applicant’s absconding was not sufficient to justify continuing his detention on remand for more than five years. Moreover, apart from the matter of Mr I.A.’s Lebanese origin, the decisions refusing his applications for release did not mention any circumstance capable of establishing that there was a risk he might abscond or a lack of guarantees that he would appear for trial, and the domestic courts had not considered other means of ensuring that he would appear for trial, such as the lodging of a security.", "With regard to the disturbance of public order likely to have been caused by the crime in question, the Commission noted that the French courts had cited this ground only on rare occasions and in a purely abstract manner.", "\nIn short, the applicant’s detention on remand had lasted for so long that it required a particularly convincing justification, which the Government had not been able to supply.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "(a)\tPrinciples established by the Court’s case-law", "102.  It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the true facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals, that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention.", "The persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence – a point which was not contested in the present case – is a condition sine qua non for the validity of the continued detention, but, after a certain lapse of time, it no longer suffices; the Court must then establish whether the other grounds cited by the judicial authorities continue to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds are “relevant” and “sufficient”, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed “special diligence” in the conduct of the proceedings (see, among other authorities, the Letellier v. France judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, p. 18, § 35).", "(b)\tApplication to the present case", "103.  It appears from the documents on the domestic proceedings at the Court’s disposal that, during the period considered, the French courts ruled on the applicant’s detention on remand fifty-seven times at first instance (orders of 9 December 1991, 29 May, 14 September, 17 November and 4 December 1992, 13 January, 5 March, 2 April, 10 May, 4, 18 and 25 June, 9 and 23 July, 13 and 23 August, 3 and 14 September, 15 and 29 October, 5 and 22 November and 10 and 17 December 1993, 7 and 21 January, 4, 14 and 22 February, 4, 11 and 18 March, 16 and 23 September, 18 October, 21, 25 and 30 November and 2 December 1994, 10 January, 26 July, 4, 11, 18 and 25 August, 1 and 29 September, 20 and 26 October, 3, 10, 17 and 24 November and 1 and 6 December 1995 and judgments of 17 January and \n11 December 1996) and five times on appeal (judgments of 26 June 1992, 21 April 1993, 23 November 1993, and 25 January and 20 December 1995).", "The grounds for their decisions refer to Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which detention on remand cannot be ordered or extended unless it is “the sole means” “of preserving evidence”, “of preventing pressure being brought to bear on witnesses or victims”, or “of preventing collusion between persons under investigation and accomplices”, or is “necessary” to “protect the person concerned”, to “put an end to the offence or prevent its repetition”, to “ensure that the person concerned remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities” or to “preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence” (see paragraph 83 above). ", "Before considering the relevance and adequacy of these grounds in the present case, the Court observes that those relating to the need to ensure that the applicant remained at the disposal of the judicial authorities and to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence appear in practically every one of these decisions, whereas the other grounds are not found so regularly. Moreover, although the decisions set out the “legal” grounds on which they are based, many of them contain very few details about the “factual” considerations underpinning them.", "(i)\tThe need to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence", "104.  This ground appears in most of the decisions concerning the applicant’s detention on remand – with the exception of those of 16 June 1992, 21 April, 18 and 25 June, 23 July, 23 November and 10 December 1993, 25 January and 20 December 1995 and 17 January 1996.", "The Court accepts that, by reason of their particular gravity and public reaction to them, certain offences may give rise to a social disturbance capable of justifying pre-trial detention, at least for a time. In exceptional circumstances this factor may therefore be taken into account for the purposes of the Convention, in any event in so far as domestic law recognises the notion of disturbance to public order caused by an offence. However, this ground can be regarded as relevant and sufficient only provided that it is based on facts capable of showing that the accused's release would actually disturb public order. In addition, detention will continue to be legitimate only if public order actually remains threatened; its continuation cannot be used to anticipate a custodial sentence (see the previously cited Letellier judgment, p. 21, § 51).", "\nThe above conditions have not been satisfied in the present case, since those of the decisions in issue which go some way towards substantiating this ground do no more than refer in an abstract manner to the nature of the crime concerned, the circumstances in which it was committed and, occasionally, the reactions of the victim’s family.", "(ii)\tThe need to ensure that the applicant remained at the disposal of the judicial authorities", "105.  All the decisions relating to Mr I.A.’s detention on remand cite this ground, since the competent courts considered that there was a risk the applicant might abscond if released. They are based in the main on the applicant’s links with Lebanon and, in some cases, his “conduct” (that applies to the order of 23 September 1994 and most of the subsequent decisions) and the penalty to which he was liable (orders of 4 December 1992 and 13 January 1993).", "These are undoubtedly circumstances which suggest a danger of flight, and the evidence in the file tends to show their relevance in the instant case. Nevertheless, the Court notes the sketchiness of the reasoning given on this point in the decisions in issue. It further notes that, although such a danger necessarily decreases as time passes (see the Neumeister v. Austria judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p. 39, § 10), the judicial authorities omitted to state exactly why in the present case there was reason to consider that it persisted for more than five years.", "106.  The Court notes, like the Government, that the decisions in issue referred to the inadequacy of judicial supervision and therefore accepts that the question whether the applicant was capable of providing adequate guarantees that he would appear for trial if released was considered. Here again, however, it can only note the deficient reasoning of the decisions concerned.", "(iii)\tThe need to prevent repetition of the offence", "107.  This ground appears to be of secondary importance in the light of the circumstances of the case. Besides, the orders which cite it – those of 23 September, 18 October and 21 and 25 November 1994 – do not mention any consideration capable of substantiating it in those circumstances.", "(iv)\tThe need to protect the applicant", "108.  The Court accepts that in some cases the safety of a person under investigation requires his continued detention, for a time at least. However, this can only be so in exceptional circumstances having to do with the nature of the offences concerned, the conditions in which they were committed and the context in which they took place.", "\nIn the present case this ground appears in the order of 9 December 1991, but not in that of 16 June 1992; it is repeated in the orders of 14 September, 17 November and 4 December 1992, but is missing from that of 13 January 1993; it reappears in the orders of 5 March and 2 April 1993 but is no longer found in the decisions of 21 April, 10 May and 4, 18 and 25 June 1993; it is cited again in that of 9 July 1993, but not in that of 23 July 1993, and then reappears in the seven orders made between 13 August and 5 November 1993; it is not mentioned in the decisions of 22 and 23 November and 10 December 1993, but is mentioned in that of 17 December 1993; it is missing from the decision of 7 January 1994, but is found again in those of 21 January and 4, 14 and 22 February 1994; the decisions of 4 and 11 March no longer refer to it, but it reappears in that of 18 March 1994.", "This ground was therefore cited intermittently by the judicial authorities, as if the dangers threatening the applicant regularly disappeared and reappeared.", "Moreover, the few decisions which refer to factors that might explain why there was a need to protect the applicant mention the risk of “revenge attacks by the victim’s family” or “reprisals” (orders of 9 December 1991 and 4 December 1992), or the “fear” expressed by the applicant on account of the “frequently barbaric and unjust [Lebanese] customs” (orders of 14 September and 17 November 1992). In particular, they omit to specify why there was such a need when almost all the victim’s family lived in Lebanon.", "(v)\tThe risk of collusion with accomplices", "109.  This ground appears in the decisions of 4 December 1992, 13 January 1993, 30 November and 2 December 1994 and 10 and 25 January 1995.", "It seems natural that the investigating judge should have envisaged at the beginning of his inquiries the possibility that the accused had not acted alone, and should therefore have formed the view that there was a risk of collusion which made it necessary for the applicant’s detention to continue. In that respect, the terms of the order of 4 December 1992 (see paragraph 34 above) are convincing. However, it appears from the case file that there was no subsequent evidence to support that hypothesis: thus, with the passage of time, this ground lost its relevance.", "(vi)\tThe risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses and of evidence being destroyed", "110.  The risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses first appears in the decisions of 14 September and 17 November 1992 but is no longer found in those of 4 December 1992 and 13 January 1993; it \nreappears in that of 5 March 1993 but is not mentioned in that of 2 April 1993; it is repeated in those of 21 April, 10 May and 4 June 1993, but is not found in those of 18 and 25 June and 9 and 23 July 1993; it reappears in the seven orders made between 8 August 1993 and 5 November 1993, then disappears from the decisions of 22 and 23 November and 10 December 1993, only to return in those of 17 December 1993 and 7 January 1994; it is not found in the order of 14 February 1994, but appears again in the eight orders made between 22 February and 21 November 1994; it is missing from the four decisions given between 25 November 1994 and 10 January 1995, but appears in the eighteen decisions given between 25 January 1995 and 17 January 1996.", "The risk of evidence being destroyed is mentioned for the first time in the decision of 14 September 1992; with the exception of the order of 17 December 1993, the twenty-four decisions given between 17 November 1992 and 21 January 1994 no longer mention it; it is repeated in those of 4 and 14 February 1994, but not in that of 22 February 1994, and reappears in that of 4 March 1994 but is not found in that of 11 March 1994; it returns in the five decisions given between 18 March 1994 and 21 November 1994 but not in that of 25 November 1994; it appears for the last time in the orders of 30 November and 2 December 1994 and 10 January 1995.", "The Court finds it hard to understand how such risks could fluctuate in such a way. It accepts nevertheless – as the competent judicial authorities noted – that they were apparent from the applicant’s personality and his attitude during the investigation. However, although they thus justified the applicant’s detention at the beginning, they necessarily gradually lost their relevance as the few witnesses in the case were interviewed and the investigations proceeded.", "It is true that the inquiry conducted after the burglary of 4 May 1993 at Mr I.A.’s home revealed that it had been carried out at his behest with the aim of removing certain documents (see paragraph 40 above). It can easily be understood how an event of that nature could lead the investigating authorities to fear that, if released, the accused might endeavour to conceal other evidence. It appears, however, from the case file that at the stage of the proceedings at which the burglary took place most of the evidence had already been gathered – moreover, on 24 October 1994 the investigating judge ordered the removal of the seals placed on the applicant’s house (see paragraph 60 above).", "\nc)\tConclusion", "111.  To have been compatible with the Convention, the considerable length of the deprivation of liberty suffered by the applicant should have been based on particularly convincing justifications. But the above considerations show at the very least that the initial relevance of the grounds cited by the French courts investigating the offence for their decisions as to the continuation of the applicant’s detention did not stand the test of time.", "112.  In short, through its excessive length, the detention in issue breached Article 5 § 3.", "II.\talleged violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention", "113.  Mr I.A. further complained of the length of the criminal proceedings against him and relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which provides:", "“In the determination of … any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a … hearing within a reasonable time by [a] … tribunal…”", "A.\tPeriod to be taken into consideration", "114.  Those appearing before the Court agreed that the period to be taken into consideration began on the date when Mr I.A. was charged.", "115.  With regard to the end of the period concerned, the Court notes that, as Mr I.A. and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out – the Government not stating an opinion on this point – the proceedings have not yet ended since the Maine-et-Loire Assize Court’s judgment of 20 March 1997 was quashed and annulled and the case remitted to the Loire-Atlantique Assize Court (see paragraph 80 above). To date, therefore, the proceedings have lasted approximately six years and nine months.", "B.\t\tReasonableness of the length of the proceedings", "116.  The applicant submitted that, at best, he would be tried by the Loire-Atlantique Assize Court some time during the last three months of 1998, that is approximately seven years after being charged, and that such a lapse of time could not be described as “reasonable”.", "117.  The Government maintained that the length of the proceedings was entirely attributable to the applicant’s conduct during the investigation.", "\n118.  In its report of 10 September 1997 the Commission expressed the opinion, firstly, that the investigation had been conducted without interruption and had required numerous investigative measures including a number of expert reports, and secondly that by his numerous applications and requests for further investigative measures Mr I.A. had substantially contributed to prolonging the proceedings. It accordingly concluded that the length of the proceedings was not excessive.", "At the hearing, however, the Delegate expressed the opinion that this question should be considered in the light of the recent “new turn” the case had taken and the “resulting increase” in the length of the proceedings.", "119.  The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings is to be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case, regard being had to the criteria laid down in the Court’s case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the applicant’s conduct and that of the competent authorities (see, among many other authorities, the Kemmache judgment cited above, p. 27, § 60, and the Reinhardt and Slimane-Kaïd v. France judgment of 31 March 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, p. 662, § 97).", "120.  In the present case the stage of the proceedings subsequent to the judgment committing the applicant for trial (24 January 1996), as matters stand on the date of adoption of the present judgment, cannot be seriously criticised from the standpoint of Article 6 § 1: the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation gave judgment as early as 25 June 1996 on the applicant’s appeal on points of law against that judgment (see paragraph 77 above) and it was in response to an application from the applicant that, at the hearing on 11 December 1996, the Maine-et-Loire Assize Court adjourned the case to its next session (see paragraph 78 above); that court then gave judgment on 20 March 1997 (see paragraph 79 above) as the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation did on 1 April 1998 (see paragraph 80 above).", "121.  It is the length of the preparatory investigation – more than four years and six months – which raises questions.", "The conduct of the judicial authorities handling the investigation is not exempt from criticism. In that connection, the Court notes in particular that the late transmission of the case to the investigating judge at the Angers tribunal de grande instance slowed down the progress of the proceedings.", "Nevertheless, the case was sufficiently complex “factually” to explain certain delays. In addition, although the applicant cannot be criticised for lodging applications for his release, however numerous these may have been, or for constantly denying that he had committed murder, he too substantially contributed to the protractedness of the investigation: firstly, the burglary of 4 May 1993 (see paragraph 40 above) entailed additional inquiries; secondly, a deliberate attempt by Mr I.A. to delay the investigation is evident from the file – one example being the fact that he waited to be informed that communication of the file to the public prosecutor was imminent before requesting, on 19 July 1995, a number of additional investigative measures (see paragraph 65 above).", "122.  Having regard to the foregoing, and considering the proceedings as matters stand on the date of adoption of the present judgment, the Court concludes that there has been no breach of Article 6 § 1.", "III.\tapplication of Article 50 of the Convention", "123.  Under Article 50 of the Convention,", "“If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ...
