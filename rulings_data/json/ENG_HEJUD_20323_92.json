It originated in an application (no. 20323/92) against the Hellenic Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under Article 25 by one hundred and thirty-two natural or legal persons of that State on 30 June 1992. Only thirty-five of those have the status of applicants before the Court (see paragraph 83 below). Having initially been designated by their initials during the proceedings before the Commission, they subsequently consented to the disclosure of their identities. The names of the applicants before the Court are as follows: \nMr M. Anatolitis, Mr C. Economidis-Doumbas, Mr T. Frangos, Mr S. Georgiadis, Mrs M. Georgiadou-Michaïl, Mrs A.

Voudouris, Mr V. Xeromeritis and Mr J. Zoungos.", "The Government’s application referred to Articles 44 and 48 of the Convention. The object of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "2.  In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 30).", "3.  The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr N. Valticos, the elected judge of Greek nationality (Article 43 of the Convention), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 4 (b)). On 20 January 1997, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr B. Walsh, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici, Mr P. Jambrek and Mr P. van Dijk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 5).", "As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicants’ lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 § 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence on 25 February 1997, the Registrar received the memorials of the applicants and the Government on 11 and 20 June 1997 respectively. On 17 September 1997 the applicants filed an additional memorial on the application of Article 50 of the Convention.", "4.  In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 22 October 1997. The Court had held a preliminary meeting beforehand.", "\nThere appeared before the Court:", "(a)\tfor the Government\nMr\tV.

The President gave the Government leave to reply, which they did on 24 November 1997.", "5.  Subsequently Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, substitute judge, replaced Mr Ryssdal, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1).", "AS TO THE FACTS", "I.\tTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE", "A.\tBackground to the case", "6.  The Bank of Central Greece (“the BCG”) is a company incorporated under Greek law, whose head office is in Athens. On 13 September 1984 its \ncapital amounted to 670,000,000 drachmas (GRD), divided into 670,000 shares of a nominal value of GRD 1,000 each.", "7.  On 13 September 1984 the Governor of the Bank of Greece, exercising the powers conferred on him by Presidential Decree no. 861/1975, ratified by Law no. 236/1975, in conjunction with Law no. 1266/1982, placed the BCG under the control of a temporary administrator (Prosorinos Epitropos). The Governor took this decision in the light of the following circumstances: (1) the result of an inquiry conducted by the competent authorities of the Bank of Greece, who had concluded that a series of illegal transactions had been carried out by the BCG’s directors; (2) the fact that the BCG’s directors had attempted to obstruct the inquiry; and (3) “the urgency of the situation, the public interest and that of the BCG, its shareholders and the third parties concerned”. Pursuant to paragraph 2 of this decision of the Governor of the Bank of Greece (decision no. 397/13.9.84), from the time when decision no. 397/84 was published in the Official Gazette (Efimerida Kyvernisseos), the BCG’s organs lost all their previous powers, which were transferred, together with responsibility for the bank’s administration, to the temporary administrator. The latter was ordered to submit to the Governor of the Bank of Greece, within two months, a detailed report on the BCG’s finances, accounts and management.", "8.  On 13 November 1984 the temporary administrator (Mr I. Oikonomopoulos) submitted his report and tendered his resignation, with effect from 18 December 1984. On that date the Governor of the Bank of Greece appointed a second temporary administrator (Mr I. Papakonstantinos), who submitted his report on 28 January 1985.", "9.  On 28 July 1986 the Governor of the Bank of Greece invited the BCG to increase its capital within ninety days to GRD 1,500,000,000, by issuing new fully paid-up shares. On 29 July 1986 the temporary administrator, exercising powers normally conferred at the general meeting of shareholders, decided, by decision no. 70/86, to increase the BCG’s capital to GRD 1,700,000,000, at the same time amending the relevant provision (Article 6) of its articles of association. By a notice published in a daily newspaper, the BCG invited its shareholders to exercise by 27 August 1986 the option to purchase the new shares which they were guaranteed under the articles of association and to pay one quarter of the value of these shares within two months (first increase in capital).", "10.  On 24 September 1986 the temporary administrator adopted decision no. 71/86, modifying decision no. 70/86. The only notable change was that those who were interested in purchasing the new shares were invited to pay for them in full by 27 October 1986. Considering that this new decision \nintroduced only “changes of form”, the temporary administrator expressly provided therein that it was to apply retrospectively from the date of publication of decision no. 70/86. As a result, in accordance with the decision’s express wording, the time-limit for exercising the shareholders’ option was still 27 August 1986. The applicants did not exercise that option.", "11.  On 2 October 1986 the Governor of the Bank of Greece approved decision no. 71/86 and on 7 October 1986 the Prefect of Athens approved the necessary amendment to the BCG’s articles of association. On 31 October 1986 the temporary administrator decided to allocate the new shares to: (a) G. Koskotas, (b) “Edrassi – X. Psallidas Ate”, (c) G. Galanopoulos, (d) M. Maissis and (e) D. Mitropoulos. However, Mr G. Koskotas became the BCG’s majority shareholder (with 1,025,565 of the 1,030,000 shares).", "12.  On 1 November 1986 the Governor of the Bank of Greece appointed a new temporary administrator (Mr S. Kalamitsis), on the ground that the previous one had contravened the law in his decision as to how the new shares were to be allocated.", "13.  On 5 November 1986 the new temporary administrator rescinded the decision taken by his predecessor on 31 October 1986 and decided to allocate the shares previously transferred to Mr G. Koskotas to the Agricultural Bank of Greece, a public-sector company, which accordingly became the BCG’s majority shareholder. However, existing shareholders were not invited to exercise their option.", "14.  On 13 November 1986 the Governor of the Bank of Greece appointed an administrator to run the BCG, stipulating in the appointment decision that the administrator was to hand over management to an elected board of directors as soon as possible. On 15 February 1987 a new board of directors was elected by the general meeting of BCG shareholders.", "15.  On 16 February 1987 Parliament enacted Law no. 1682/1987, pursuant to which a number of administrative decisions concerning the BCG, including all those mentioned above, acquired the force of law. Law no. 1682/1987 also amended the articles of association of the Agricultural Bank of Greece, which had been laid down by a previous law, so as to enable it to take part in the increases in the share capital of other banks.", "16.  On 14 June 1987 the general meeting of BCG shareholders decided to increase the capital to GRD 3,300,000,000 (second increase).", "17.  On 1 June 1989 Parliament enacted Law no. 1858/1989, which applied retrospectively and established an authoritative interpretation of Presidential Decree no. 861/1975. According to this interpretation, temporary administrators had the power to increase the capital of the banks they had been appointed to run.", "\n18.  On 11 June 1989 the BCG’s capital was increased by a further GRD 125,000,000 (third increase).", "19.  On 30 September 1990 the general meeting of BCG shareholders decided to apply to have its shares listed on the Athens stock exchange, to increase its capital by GRD 1,282,250,000, to offer the new shares for sale on the stock market and to amend Articles 6 and 7 of the BCG’s articles of association accordingly (fourth increase).", "20.  On 9 November 1990 the Monetary and Financial Affairs Committee (Epitropi nomismaton kai pistotikon thematon) of the Bank of Greece approved the above-mentioned amendment of the BCG’s articles of association. On 11 December 1990 the Capital Market Committee (Epitropi kefaleagoras) authorised the BCG to allocate the new shares by offering them for sale on the stock market.", "21.  On 22 June and 22 October 1993 the BCG’s capital was increased by GRD 256,250,000 (fifth increase).", "22.  On 29 July and 17 August 1994 the BCG’s capital was increased by GRD 8,055,000,000 (sixth increase).", "B.\t\tJudicial proceedings to challenge the increases in capital", "1.\tThe proceedings in the Supreme Administrative Court", "23.  On 1 December 1986 some of the applicants challenged in the Supreme Administrative Court decisions nos. 854/2.10.86 and 21543/7.10.86 by which the Governor of the Bank of Greece and the Prefect of Athens had approved the first increase in the BCG’s capital. In their application for judicial review they alleged that the temporary administrator was not empowered under Greek law to order an increase in capital, which should have been done by a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders.", "24.  On 10 December 1986 the President of the Fourth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court decided to hear the case on 2 June 1987.", "25.  On 2 June 1987 the Fourth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court decided of its own motion to adjourn until 27 October 1987 consideration of the application for judicial review lodged on 1 December 1986. On 27 October 1987 the Supreme Administrative Court decided of its own motion to adjourn the case until 2 February 1988 and later until 19 April 1988. According to the Government, the reason for all these adjournments was the importance and complexity of the legal questions which the reporting judge had to consider.", "\n26.  On 19 April 1988 the Fourth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court heard the application for judicial review. On 14 June 1988 it held, in decision no. 2668/88, (a) that the temporary administrator had not been empowered under Greek law to order the increase in capital of 24 September 1986; (b) that Law no. 1682/1987 could not be taken into account because it had been enacted after the application for judicial review had been made, contrary to the constitutional principle of the separation of powers; (c) that the two applicants could not challenge the administrative decisions in question because before 13 September 1984 they had held less than 5% of the capital; and (d) that because of its importance the case should be referred to the plenary court.", "27.  On 12 September 1988 the President of the Supreme Administrative Court decided that the application for judicial review would be heard on 2 December 1988. On that date the Supreme Administrative Court decided of its own motion to adjourn the case until 12 May 1989 and later until 6 October 1989. On the latter date the Supreme Administrative Court decided of its own motion to adjourn the case until 9 February 1990 and later until 27 April 1990. According to the Government, all these adjournments were prompted by the same considerations as those referred to above.", "28.  On 27 April 1990 the Supreme Administrative Court decided of its own motion to adjourn consideration of the application for judicial review until 26 October 1990. According to the applicants, this adjournment was accepted by all the parties. The Government maintained that it was requested by the applicants and supplied a certificate to that effect from the registry of the Supreme Administrative Court.", "29.  On 26 October 1990 the Supreme Administrative Court again decided to adjourn the case, this time until 8 March 1991. According to a certificate from the registry of the Supreme Administrative Court, the court decided of its own motion to adjourn the hearing. According to the Government, record no. 41/1990 of the plenary court proves that the applicants requested the adjournment concerned pending the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in a similar case and that the respondents opposed that request. The reporting judge considered that the case should be adjourned.", "30.  On 8 March 1991 the Supreme Administrative Court decided of its own motion to adjourn consideration of the application for judicial review until 17 May 1991. On that date it once again adjourned the case, until 11 October 1991. The applicants maintained that all parties had been present at the hearing on 17 May 1991 and that they had requested that the case be tried. However, as the respondents objected, the Supreme Administrative Court had adjourned the case of its own motion. According to the \nGovernment, the case could not be heard on 17 May 1991 because of a strike by lawyers, as attested by a certificate issued by the Athens Bar Association. They also submitted in that connection a certificate from the registry of the Supreme Administrative Court, dated 31 October 1995.", "31.  On 11 October 1991 the application for judicial review came before the Supreme Administrative Court. However, the National Union of Bank Employees (OTOE), which had intervened in the proceedings, requested an adjournment. The Supreme Administrative Court allowed this request and adjourned the case until 22 November 1991. According to the applicants, the request was supported by the respondents, whereas they themselves had insisted that the hearing should take place. The State authorities had themselves requested this adjournment, as was proved by, inter alia, a written request submitted on 26 September 1991 by the Minister for Economic Affairs, who had intervened in the proceedings concerning the application to the Supreme Administrative Court for judicial review.", "32.  On 22 November 1991 the application lodged on 1 December 1986 was finally considered. On 17 April 1992, in judgment no. 1544/1992, the plenary of the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the application. It observed that, pursuant to Law no. 2190/1920, a decision taken by the general meeting of shareholders of a company set up in accordance with that Law could be challenged only by shareholders who held at least 5% of the capital, had been present at the meeting when the decision was taken and had opposed it. Parliament had had good reasons to restrict the right of access to the courts in such a way. The right to challenge decisions of the general meeting should be vested only in shareholders who were closely associated with the company’s activities, in which small shareholders were usually not interested. In addition, the company’s competitors could very easily acquire a small number of shares and attempt to harm its interests. The same restrictions applied to the right of access to a court for the purpose of challenging administrative decisions approving those of the general meeting of shareholders. Shareholders who held less than 5% of the capital could challenge an administrative decision of this type only if they could prove that it affected them personally. An increase in the company’s capital could not in itself harm the interests of a shareholder who held less than 5% of the capital. Moreover, the same rules were applicable where the decision to increase the capital had been taken by a temporary administrator. In the instant case, on 29 July 1986 the applicants had held 3.35% of the BCG’s capital (one having 0.37% and the other 2.98%) and would therefore not have been able to challenge the increase in capital if it had been decided upon by a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders. The applicants could not rely on the fact that they now held a lower proportion of the shares in order to establish that their personal interests had been harmed by the decision to increase the capital. Nor had they pleaded any other fact which could warrant such a conclusion. Accordingly, the Supreme Administrative Court decided by a majority to dismiss the application for judicial review, on the ground that the applicants did not have locus standi.", "2.\tThe proceedings in the civil courts", "(a)\tThe judicial proceedings concerning actions nos. 10429/1986, 5220/1989, 11301/1990, 6137/1991 and 5055/1993", "33.  On 22 December 1986 some of the applicants brought action no. 10429/1986 against the BCG and others in the Athens District Court, seeking a declaration (a) that the first increase in capital was null and void on the ground that the second temporary administrator (Mr I. Papakonstantinos) had not been empowered under Greek law to take such a decision, which was the prerogative of the general meeting of shareholders, and (b) that the allocation of 1,030,000 new shares to the defendant shareholders by the third temporary administrator (Mr S. Kalamitsis) had been unlawful and was null and void, and that in law it had not conferred on any of these persons the status of shareholder, a right to attend general meetings of BCG’s shareholders or any other right vested in its shareholders. A hearing was listed for 4 February 1987.", "34.  However, on 14 January 1987 two of the applicants withdrew from action no. 10429/1986. In their notice of discontinuation (no. 1025/1987), they declared to the court that they expressly, unreservedly and irrevocably recognised as absolutely legal, valid and unchallengeable all the transactions carried out by the two temporary administrators concerned (see paragraph 33 above).", "35.  On 4 February 1987 the Athens District Court decided to adjourn consideration of action no. 10429/1986 until 18 February 1987. According to the applicants, this adjournment was ordered at the defendants’ request.", "36.  On 18 February 1987 the Athens District Court tried action no. 10429/1986. In its decision no. 3427/87 of 29 April 1987, the court decided to stay the proceedings pending delivery of the Supreme Administrative Court’s judgment on the related application for judicial review lodged on 1 December 1986 (see paragraph 23 above). According to the applicants, the court took this decision at the defendants’ request. On the other hand, the Government referred to the text of the decision, which stated that it was necessary to adjourn consideration of action no. 10429/1986 because its outcome depended on the validity of the appointment of the third temporary administrator (Mr S. Kalamitsis) and the legality of the decision taken by the previous temporary administrator (Mr I. Papakonstantinos) on the increase in capital, these being matters in issue in another case then pending in the Supreme Administrative Court (Article 249 of the Code of Civil Procedure).", "\n37.  On 13 June 1989 some of the applicants brought action no. 5220/1989 against the BCG in the Athens District Court, seeking a declaration that the second increase in capital had been in breach of Greek law and was null and void. They argued that, because the first increase in capital was not legally valid, the general meeting of shareholders which had passed the resolution authorising the second increase had not been duly and properly constituted. A hearing was listed for 11 October 1989.", "38.  On 11 October 1989 the Athens District Court decided to adjourn consideration of action no. 5220/1989 until 31 January 1990. According to the applicants, this adjournment was ordered at the defendant’s request.", "39.  At the hearing on 31 January 1990 the case was not called because it had not been placed on the court’s list, as certified by its registrar. According to the Government, this delay was imputable to the applicants, who had not taken the necessary steps to have their action placed on the court’s list.", "40.  On 23 November 1990 some of the applicants brought action no. 11301/1990 against the BCG in the Athens District Court, seeking a declaration that the fourth increase in capital (resolution of the general meeting of shareholders on 30 September 1990 – see paragraph 19 above) had been in breach of Greek and European Community law and was null and void. Again it was contended that the first increase and the allocation of the 1,030,000 new shares to new shareholders – ordered by the then temporary administrator – had been unlawful and were null and void.

According to the Government, these adjournments were necessary in view of the fact that the Supreme Administrative Court had not yet given judgment on the application for judicial review, a precondition that had been laid down in the decision (no. 3427/87) to adjourn consideration of the first action (no. 10429/1986).", "46.  On 12 May 1992 some of the applicants intervened in the proceedings concerning action no. 10429/1986, supporting the plaintiffs.

It also decided not to entertain the applicants’ arguments concerning the impossibility in practice of exercising their option, since they had not been raised in time. It likewise dismissed the four actions in so far as they concerned the allegation that the decisions concerning the increases in capital had not been taken in accordance with Greek law. However, the court referred to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, for a preliminary ruling, the questions of Community law raised by the cases. It reserved its decision on the defendants’ objection concerning the plaintiffs’ abuse of rights (Article 281 of the Greek Civil Code) until it had learned how the Court of Justice of the European Communities had applied European law.

Still on 2 November 1994 it tried case no. 23/1994. Its judgment was given on 31 January 1995.

It also rejected the BCG’s new board of directors’ argument that the applicants’ civil action constituted an abuse of rights, declaring: “… the uniform application and full effect of Community law would be undermined if a shareholder relying on Article 25 § 1 of the Second Directive were deemed to be abusing his rights merely because he was a minority shareholder of a company subject to reorganization measures or had benefited from the reorganization of the company. Since Article 25 § 1 applies without distinction to all shareholders, regardless of the outcome of any reorganization procedure, to treat an action based on Article 25 § 1 as abusive for such reasons would be tantamount to altering the scope of that provision.”", "74.  On 20 March 1996 the applicants again asked the Athens District Court to fix a hearing date for all their actions.

On 27 February 1997 final decisions nos. 1499/1997 and 1500/1997, which dismissed all these actions, were published. The applicants asserted that the court dismissed all their claims “without taking into account the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Communities” and that this, which was unprecedented in Greek law, constituted a serious breach of Community law. They asserted that the defendants – represented by the Minister for Economic Affairs and other parties under his control – had asked the Athens District Court in their written submissions to ignore completely the Luxembourg Court’s ad hoc judgment.", "81.  However, the proceedings in the civil courts are still pending on account of an appeal (anairessi) to the Court of Cassation lodged by the applicants.", "PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION", "82.  The one hundred and thirty-two applicants applied to the Commission on 30 June 1992.

In its report of 4 September 1996 (Article 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention had been breached in two of the nine sets of proceedings complained of. The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.", "FINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT", "84.  In their memorial the Government asked the Court to “dismiss the application before it”.", "85.  At the hearing the applicants asked the Court to hold that Article 6 of the Convention had been breached “in all the civil proceedings, not just in those where the Commission [had] found a violation”.", "AS TO THE LAW", "I.\tALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION", "86.  The applicants complained of the length of the proceedings in the Supreme Administrative Court and the Athens District Court.

In addition, in their eight actions in the Athens District Court, they challenged the lawfulness under Greek and European Community law of the six increases in the BCG’s capital – on the ground that they had not been ordered by a duly constituted general meeting of shareholders – or requested the court to refer to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for a preliminary ruling a question connected to the reference for a preliminary ruling of 3 August 1993.", "Like the Commission, the Court considers that the purpose of the proceedings in question was to settle a dispute (“contestation”) over the applicants’ “civil rights and obligations”, since, as BCG shareholders, they could arguably claim under Greek and European Community legislation the right to vote on the increase in the bank’s capital and thus participate in decisions concerning the value of their shares.", "Article 6 § 1 is therefore applicable in the case.", "B.\t\tCompliance with Article 6 § 1", "88.  According to the Government, neither the Greek courts nor the applicants’ opponents could be considered responsible for the delays which occurred between 22 December 1986, when the applicants brought their first action in the Athens District Court, and 12 March 1996, when the Court of Justice of the European Communities gave judgment: a delay of five and a half years had been due to the proceedings in the Supreme Administrative Court, another, of one year, to the strike by members of the Athens Bar and a third, of two years and eight months, to the proceedings concerning the reference to the Luxembourg Court for a preliminary ruling.", "The outcome of all the actions in which the applicants challenged the lawfulness of the decisions of the general meeting of shareholders depended on the District Court’s view of the validity of the first increase in the BCG’s capital. All of the delays which had held up consideration of these actions were without significance because the court would in any case have adjourned trial until its judgment on the first action had become final.", "On 18 February 1987 the District Court decided, in accordance with Article 249 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to reserve judgment until the Supreme Administrative Court had ruled on the applicants’ application for judicial review. As a result, from the beginning of the proceedings in the District Court (on 22 December 1986) to the end of the proceedings in the Supreme Administrative Court (on 17 April 1992), the Greek courts and the State bore no responsibility whatsoever, irrespective of the reasons – and these were in any event valid – for which the proceedings conducted during that period had been adjourned. It was the applicants who had first applied to the Supreme Administrative Court and they could accordingly not complain of delays caused by the proceedings in that court. The Supreme Administrative Court had to review the conformity of certain provisions of banking legislation with the Greek Constitution and with Community law; the nature of the case and its major importance fully justified the adjournments ordered by the Supreme Administrative Court of its own motion. It was indeed the first time in the history of the Greek courts that it had been required to determine such issues, whose consequences were not limited to the relations between the opposing parties but affected the economy of the entire country.", "Furthermore, the delivery of the Supreme Administrative Court’s judgment had coincided with the long strike by members of the Athens Bar, which had delayed trial of the applicants’ first civil action by about a year.", "\nLastly, it was the applicants who had asked the District Court to refer a question to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for a preliminary ruling. But the Court of Justice had not delivered its judgment until 12 March 1996, which meant that, even if the applicants’ civil actions had been heard before that date, the court would certainly have stayed the proceedings until the Court of Justice had given its ruling.", "89.  The applicants submitted that, in all the domestic proceedings, their opponents had been the Bank of Greece, the Agricultural Bank and the BCG, all owned or controlled by the State; their conduct could thus be equated with that of the State.", "Out of a total of twelve adjournments before the Supreme Administrative Court, eleven were imputable to the State. The size of the file, which had been mentioned by the Government, could not give a serious indication of the complexity of the case. The argument relating to the reporting judge’s heavy workload in fact confirmed the State’s responsibility. Lastly, it had been unnecessary and unjustified for the Fourth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court to relinquish jurisdiction in favour of the plenary court. ", "From the procedural point of view, the decision of the Governor of the Bank of Greece and the Prefect of Athens to approve the increase in the BCG’s capital was an individual administrative decision which had been contested by the applicants by means of their application to the Supreme Administrative Court for judicial review; for as long as that decision had not been set aside, the Athens District Court had the power and the duty to review its lawfulness, independently of the judicial review proceedings, and – if it found it to be unlawful – to declare it null and void.", "The strike by members of the Athens Bar could not validly be pleaded, since an adjournment for such a reason was certainly not compulsory; even if all the parties were not present in the courtroom, the courts had discretion whether to proceed with the hearing, and in any case no lawyer was in any danger of being penalised by the Bar Association’s disciplinary council for ignoring the Bar’s call to strike.", "90.  The Commission expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the judicial review proceedings in the Supreme Administrative Court and in the proceedings relating to action no. 10429/1986 (in so far as this had been brought by some of the applicants only) in the Athens District Court, but not in the other proceedings.", "1.\tGeneral considerations concerning all the sets of proceedings complained of", "91.  The Court does not question the complexity of the case or the importance of what was at stake for the parties to the proceedings in issue. It accepts the Government’s submission that the dispute the Supreme Administrative Court and the Athens District Court were required to settle raised serious questions regarding the interpretation of Greek and European Community law and that the outcome would have important repercussions not only for the parties to the various sets of proceedings but also for the country’s economy in general. However, the dispute’s complexity alone is not sufficient to justify such lengthy delays as occurred in the present case.", "More decisive in that respect is the conduct of the parties and of the relevant judicial authorities.", "92.  The applicants and the Government blamed each other for numerous adjournments in the nine sets of proceedings complained of. The Government complained of procedural sharp practice on the applicants’ part, particularly the fact that they had registered the actions on the District Court’s list reserved for cases in which the preparations for trial were complete. On the other hand, the applicants stressed all the efforts they had made to have the hearing dates brought forward.", "93.  The Court observes that only delays imputable to the relevant judicial authorities can justify a finding that a reasonable time has been exceeded, contrary to the Convention. Even in legal systems applying the principle that the procedural initiative lies with the parties, the latter’s attitude does not absolve the courts from the obligation to ensure the expeditious trial required by Article 6 § 1.", "94.  Apart from the complexity of the case – and the conduct of the parties and the judicial authorities, which will be considered below – the Court notes that in the present case three additional factors contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings concerned. These were the reference to the Court of Justice of the European Communities for a preliminary ruling, the strike by members of the Athens Bar for nearly a year (see paragraph 96 below) and the close connection between the nine sets of proceedings.", "95.  As regards the proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the Court notes that the Athens District Court decided on 3 August 1993 to refer a question to the Court of Justice, which gave judgment on 12 March 1996. During the intervening period the proceedings in the actions concerned were stayed, which prolonged them by two years, seven months and nine days. The Court cannot, however, take this period into consideration in its assessment of the length of each particular set of proceedings: even though it may at first sight appear relatively long, to take it into account would adversely affect the system instituted by Article 177 of the EEC Treaty and work against the aim pursued in substance in that Article.", "96.  As regards the strike by members of the Athens Bar, this lasted from 20 May 1992 to 8 March 1993 and started again on 28 June 1993. The Court is aware of the damaging consequences of such a long strike; not only does it aggravate the judicial system’s structural problems, by adding to the courts’ backlog of business, but it also affects the rights and interests of those whom lawyers have a solemn duty to protect, namely litigants, who find that their cases are held up by one extra delay after another. However, notwithstanding the Bar’s legal personality under public law, it is essentially a professional association; in calling on its members to withdraw their services it was taking action designed to defend their professional interests, not exercising one of the functions of a public authority. The delays caused by the strike cannot therefore be attributed to the State.", "97.  On the question of the close connection between the different sets of proceedings, the Court notes that the Athens District Court adjourned a number of the cases concerned (in particular those relating to actions nos. 45/1994 and 7968/1994) in order to await the outcome of those relating to actions nos. 10429/1986, 5220/1989, 11301/1990, 6137/1991 and 5055/1993 and that the Fourth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the plenary court. In that connection, the Court observes that, although Article 6 of the Convention requires judicial proceedings to be conducted expeditiously, it also lays down the more general principle of the proper administration of justice. In the circumstances of the case, the fact that the proceedings in these actions were stayed and the reference to the plenary court were compatible with the fair balance which has to be struck between the various aspects of this fundamental requirement (see the Boddaert v. Belgium judgment of 12 October 1992, Series A no. 235-D, p. 82, § 39).", "The delays due to the above three factors were therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the domestic courts in general and the Supreme Administrative Court and the Athens District Court in particular. The Court will accordingly take into consideration only the delays that the latter could, in one way or another, have avoided or reduced.", "2.\tConsiderations specific to each set of proceedings ", "(a)\tThe proceedings for judicial review in the Supreme Administrative Court, brought by Mr T. Frangos, Mr C.P. Pafitis and Mr P. Pafitis", "98.  These proceedings began on 1 December 1986 and ended on 17 April 1992 with the judgment of the plenary court, in whose favour the Fourth Division had relinquished jurisdiction on 14 June 1988. They therefore lasted five years, four months and sixteen days.", "There is no doubt that this was a very lengthy period, caused partly by the reference of the case to the plenary court and partly by the twelve adjournments, eight of which – as the Government admitted – were ordered by the Supreme Administrative Court of its own motion (on 2 June and 27 October 1987, 2 February and 2 December 1988, 12 May and 6 October 1989, 9 February 1990 and 8 March 1991); the first seven of these caused a \ncontinuous period of inactivity which lasted two years and three months. Two further adjournments were requested by the parties (on 26 October 1990 and 11 October 1991) and one was due to the strike by members of the Athens Bar (on 17 May 1991).", "99.  The Government submitted that the adjournments ordered by the Supreme Administrative Court were explained by the quantity of documents the reporting judge had to study, the complexity of the legal issues raised and the major importance of the grounds of annulment relied on.

Because of this factor the majority took the view that there had been no breach of the guarantee of a hearing within a reasonable time in Article 6 § 1.", "4.  It is on this point that I dissent. In my view the applicants in the three above-mentioned cases had a right to expect that their cases would be heard within a reasonable time, irrespective of whether, in the opinion of the judges hearing the cases, it was expedient to await the outcome of case no. 10429/1986. That case was not heard within a reasonable time. The applicants in that case therefore suffered a breach of the basic right guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 and I cannot agree that the applicants in the three subsequent cases did not suffer the same kind of breach, just because their cases were made to depend on the first one. Surely it follows – logically and juridically – that the breach of the reasonable time requirement in the first case cannot be said to have purged the unreasonable delay in the three cases which followed it simply because it was juridically convenient to tie them up with the previous case which was already unreasonably long.", "5.  The judgment on this point appears (at least) to imply that the length of the proceedings in the first case serves as a justification for the length of proceedings in subsequent cases. The violation suffered by the applicants in these three cases cannot be so justified and these applicants should have been granted a remedy for the breach they suffered even though it was due to the breach suffered by others before them."]}
