Its formatting and structure may therefore differ from the Case-Law Information Note summaries.]", "I.\tQUESTIONS OF JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY", "A.\tCourt's jurisdiction to examine the Government's preliminary objections", "Court saw no reason, as matters stood, to abandon a line of case-law which had been followed constantly for over twenty years and had found expression in a large number of judgments.", "Conclusion: Court had jurisdiction (sixteen votes to five).", "B.\tMerits of the preliminary objections", "1.\tFailure to exhaust domestic remedies", "Applicant had complained in substance before the Libourne tribunal de grande instance and Bordeaux Court of Appeal of a violation of her right to respect for her private life.  Her appeal dismissed by the Court of Cassation as ill-founded, not declared inadmissible because of novelty.", "Conclusion: objection dismissed (unanimously).", "2.\tWhether application out of time", "Applicant had submitted to the Court of Cassation a point of law relating to Article 8.  No consistent case-law at the time to show in advance that her appeal was pointless.  Appeal to Court of Cassation in principle one of the remedies to be exhausted in order to comply with Article 26, and at the very least had the effect of postponing the starting-point of the six-month period.", "Conclusion: objection dismissed (unanimously).", "II.\tTHE MERITS", "A.\tArticle 8", "Notion of \"respect\" in Article 8 not clear-cut.

However, there still remained some uncertainty as to the essential nature of transsexualism and the legitimacy of surgery in such cases was still questioned. Legal situations resulting therefrom extremely complex.  No sufficiently broad consensus between the member States of the Council of Europe to persuade the Court to reach opposite conclusions to those in its Rees and Cossey judgments.

Courts of first instance and courts of appeal had already ordered similar insertions to be made in the cases of other transsexuals.  Case-law of Court of Cassation contrary to this, but could change.", "Applicant had undergone the surgical operation abroad, without the benefit of all the medical and psychological safeguards now required in France.  Operation nevertheless involved the irreversible abandonment of the external marks of her original sex.  Applicant's determination constituting a factor of sufficient significance to be taken into account, together with other factors, with reference to Article 8.", "(ii)\tChange of forenames", "Judgments supplied to the Court by the Government showed that non-recognition of a change of sex did not necessarily prevent the person in question obtaining a new forename which would better reflect his or her physical appearance. ", "Case-law not settled, however, when Libourne and Bordeaux courts gave their rulings - appeared still not to be settled as Court of Cassation had apparently never had occasion to confirm it.
