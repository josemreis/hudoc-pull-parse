The applicants, who were exhausted, did not attend. Subsequently three police officers in plain clothes visited their restaurant. They used force in disputed circumstances. Eventually, the first applicant was taken to the police station. The applicants lodged a complaint, together with an application to join the proceedings as parties claiming civil damages, in respect of, inter alia, unlawful arrest and seizure and misuse of authority by police officers. The order stating that no further action would be taken delivered by the investigating judge was upheld on appeal. The applicants appealed on a point of law, without success.", "Inadmissible under Article 8: The applicants stated before the investigating judge that the police officers had stopped at the door of the dining room of their restaurant and entered only after one of the officers had indicated that the applicant should join them and the latter had refused to do so. Those facts were also established by the Court of Appeal. It was therefore at the invitation of the applicant, who did not wish to join them in the corridor, that the police officers entered the restaurant dining room to interview him. The Court concludes that, in those circumstances at any event, the applicants cannot maintain that the police officers’ entry of the premises of their restaurant constituted a violation of their right to respect for their “home”: manifestly ill-founded.", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the "]}
