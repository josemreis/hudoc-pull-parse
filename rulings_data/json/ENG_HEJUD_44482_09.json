It asked the applicants to specify their claim submitted on 27 May 1996.", "9.  In February 2009 the applicants extended their claim and asked for the case to be joined to a different set of proceedings.

In particular, they had challenged at a higher instance the District Court judge and a decision on procedural fine.", "17.  The duration of the proceedings was partly due to the District Court’s failure to proceed in an appropriate manner in the period until March 1998. While it was true that the District Court had not proceeded with the case between 12 March 1998 and 3 June 2003, the  accepted that it had been justified by the need to follow the developments and wait for the outcome in proceedings file no. 4 C 204/96.", "2.  Judgment II.

However, a formal decision to stay proceedings file no. 9 C 171/96 had been taken on 26 May 2003, and there had been no progress in the proceedings between January 2000 and 26 May 2003.

In its judgment the  noted, in particular, that the District Court had known that a prejudicial issue was the subject-matter of proceedings 4 C 204/96 in 1997, but it had formally stayed the proceedings only five years later, in 2003. The judgment further stated that the overall length of the proceedings under considerations was excessive.", "26.  The  awarded the applicants 3,000 euros each as just satisfaction. It further ordered the District Court to avoid further delays in the proceedings and to reimburse the applicants’ costs in the constitutional proceedings.", "THE LAW", "I.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION", "27.  The applicants complained that the length of the proceedings file no. 8 C 105/96 concerning their action of 27 May 1996 had been incompatible with the “reasonable time” requirement, laid down in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...”", "28.  The Government contested that argument.", "29.  The proceedings complained of started on 27 May 1996 and they have not yet ended. They were stayed for five and half years pending the outcome of a different set of proceedings in respect of the duration of which the applicants sought separately redress before both the  and the Court (see paragraphs 7-8 and 18-20 above).", "30.  Since the Court is to address in the context of a different application the proceedings which concerned a prejudicial issue, it considers it appropriate not to take into account in the context of the present application the period during which the proceedings complained of were stayed (see, to the contrary, Probstmeier v. Germany, 1 July 1997, §§ 46, 48 and 52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV; or Matoušková v. , no. 39752/98, § 73, 12 November 2002).", "The period to be taken into consideration in the present case has thus exceeded to date ten years for two levels of jurisdiction.", "A.  Admissibility", "31.  The Government argued, with reference to the Constitutional Court’s judgment III. ÚS 317/06 of 4 September 2007, that there had been no breach of the applicants’ right to a hearing within a reasonable time during the period covered by that judgment. Their complaint in respect of that period was therefore manifestly ill-founded. As to the subsequent period, the Government argued that the applicants should have sought redress by means of a fresh complaint to the . Since they failed to do so, they did not exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.", "32.  The applicants disagreed with the Government’s arguments.", "33.  The Court notes that in its judgment III. ÚS 317/06 of 4 September 2007 the Constitutional Court found no breach of Article 6 § 1. However, it reached a conclusion to the contrary in judgments II. ÚS 78/06 and II. ÚS 47/09 in respect of different sets of proceedings in which the position was similar as in the present case (see paragraphs 21, 22, 24 and 25 above). In particular, in judgments II. ÚS 78/06 and II. ÚS 47/09 it qualified as unjustified delays the District Court’s failure to formally stay the proceedings where a prejudicial issue was to be determined in a different set of proceedings. The Court considers the reasons for such conclusion relevant and convincing.", "34.  In these circumstances, and having regard to the principles established in its practice (see Becová v.  (dec.), no. 23788/06, 12 July 2008), the Court cannot accept the argument that the applicants should have repeatedly sought redress before the  after the delivery of its judgment III. ÚS 317/06 of 4 September 2007. Accordingly, the Government’s objection must be dismissed.", "35.  The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "36.  The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicants and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicants in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, § 43, ECHR 2000-VII).", "37.  The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).", "38.  Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Among other things the Court notes, in particular, that the merits of the applicants’ action still remain to be determined by the court at first instance.", "39.  Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the “reasonable time” requirement.", "There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 § 1.", "II.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "40.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "41.  The applicants claimed jointly 68,896.92 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage. They further claimed EUR 8,000 each in respect of nonpecuniary damage.", "42.  The Government contested these claims.", "43.  The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, it awards the applicants EUR 6,000 jointly in respect of nonpecuniary damage.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "44.  The applicants also claimed EUR 6,844.05 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and the Court.", "45.  The Government left the matter to the Court’s discretion.", "46.  Regard being had to the documents in its possession and to its caselaw, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicants the sum of EUR 2,000 jointly covering costs under all heads.", "C.  Default interest", "47.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Declares the application admissible;", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;", "", "3.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicants jointly, within three months, the following amounts:", "(i)  EUR 6,000 (six thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;", "(ii)  EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicants, in respect of costs and expenses;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "4.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicants’ claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 24 July 2012, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tMarialena Tsirli\tIneta Ziemele\n\tDeputy Registrar\tPresident"]}
