They relied on Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention.", "28.  The Court notes that the applicants' complaints fall to be examined solely under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:", "“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...”", "A.  Admissibility", "29.  The Government submitted that the applicants had not exhausted the domestic remedies available to them, as they had failed to lodge with the Supreme Court requests for review of the decisions of the Higher Administrative Court of 15 March (in the first applicant's case) and 16 November 2007 (in the second applicant's case) in the light of exceptional circumstances pursuant to Article 237 of the Code of Administrative Justice of 2005. According to the Government, the issue concerned the conflicting application of procedural law by the Supreme Court and the  in the applicants' cases, falling within the ambit of the first sub-paragraph of that provision of domestic law.", "30.  The applicants disagreed.", "31.  The Court reiterates that the only remedies to be exhausted by an applicant are those which are effective. It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in both theory and practice at the relevant time (see, for instance, Miroshnik v. Ukraine, no. 75804/01, § 53, 27 November 2008).", "32.  The Court has already found in a case against Ukraine that requests for review of court decisions made in the light of exceptional circumstances, as envisaged by the Code of Administrative Justice of 2005, are akin to requests for the re-opening of the proceedings (see Karuna v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 43788/05, 3 April 2007). In this context, the Court reiterates that the Convention does not guarantee a right to have a case re-opened by means of an extraordinary remedy (see, mutatis mutandis, Prystavska v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 21287/02, 17 December 2002). Having regard to the parties' submissions on this aspect of the case, and, in particular, given the Government's failure to submit any examples of cases in which the present issue of access to a court of cassation was resolved through the impugned procedure, the Court discerns no grounds to depart from the findings it reached in Karuna (cited above). Moreover, the Court notes that such findings are consistent with its practice concerning the extraordinary review procedure in the civil law matters in the Ukrainian legal system (see Nesterova v. Ukraine, no. 10792/04, § 36, 28 May 2009). Therefore, the Court holds that the applicants were not required to pursue the procedure suggested by the Government, as it was not a remedy within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention.", "33.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government's objection. It finds that the applicants' complaints of lack of access to court are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. The Court further finds that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds and must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "34.  The applicants maintained their complaints that they had not had access to a court of cassation in violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "35.  The Government did not submit observations on the merits of the case.", "36.  The Court reiterates that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way it embodies the “right to court”, which, according to the Court's case-law, includes not only the right to institute proceedings but also the right to obtain a “determination” of the dispute by a court (see, for instance, Kutić v. Croatia, no. 48778/99, § 25, ECHR 2002II).", "37.  The Court notes that, according to its established case-law concerning Ukraine, the above guarantees enshrined in Article 6 are applicable to proceedings before courts of cassation in both civil and administrative matters, regardless of their Ukrainian classification (see Melnyk v. Ukraine, no. 23436/03, § 25, 28 March 2006, and Karuna, cited above).", "38.  In the present cases, the applicants had access to a court of cassation, in that their appeals reached both the Supreme Court and the . However, the appeals remained unexamined as firstly the Supreme Court and then the  declined jurisdiction over the applicants' cases.", "39.  The Court does not find it necessary in the circumstances to examine whether the Supreme Court or the  had jurisdiction to determine the merits of the applicants' appeals. What is important is that the applicants did not obtain a “determination” of their appeals because the  refused to follow the rulings of the Supreme Court determining jurisdiction over their cases. Such refusals not only deprived the applicants of access to court but also undermined the authority of judicial power. Having obtained final rulings of the Supreme Court, which has a constitutional position as the highest judicial body and which interprets the law in an authoritative way, the applicants had legitimate expectations that those rulings would not be challenged. In this context, the Court notes that Article 6 of the Convention requires the States to provide procedural means for effective and expedient resolution of jurisdictional conflicts (see Loyen v. France (dec.), no. 46021/99, 6 April 2000, and, mutatis mutandis, Didu v. Romania, no. 34814/02, § 29, 14 April 2009). The Court further notes that the observations of the Venice Commission and the Council of Europe Directorates are particularly relevant to this aspect of the case (see paragraph 25 above).", "40.  In the light of the foregoing and given that there is nothing in the case materials to suggest the applicants' failure to comply with the relevant procedural requirements, the Court finds that their genuine and effective enjoyment of the right of access to court was not secured. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "III.  THE REMAINING COMPLAINTS", "41.  The first applicant complained under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention of the outcome and unfairness of the proceedings, alleging that the courts had misinterpreted the law in his case and that they had been biased. He also complained under Article 14 of the Convention that he had suffered discrimination on account of the outcome of the proceedings.", "42.  The second applicant complained under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention of the outcome and unfairness of the proceedings, alleging that the courts had wrongly assessed evidence.", "43.  Having carefully examined the applicants' remaining complaints under Articles 6, 13 and 14 of the Convention in the light of all the material in its possession and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention and must be dismissed pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.", "IV.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "44.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "45.  The first applicant claimed 12,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage and also claimed the same amount for non-pecuniary damage. The second applicant did not submit a claim for just satisfaction.", "46.  The Government contested the first applicant's claims.", "47.  The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged by the first applicant; it therefore rejects the claim. On the other hand, ruling on an equitable basis, as is required by Article 41 of the Convention, it awards the first applicant EUR 2,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "48.  The Court further considers that there is no call to award the second applicant any sum for just satisfaction.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "49.  The applicants made no claim as to costs and expenses. Therefore, the Court makes no award under this head.", "C.  Default interest", "50.  The Court considers it appropriate that default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Decides to join the applications;", "", "2.  Declares the applicants' complaints under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention of lack of access to court admissible and the remainder of the applications inadmissible;", "", "3.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;", "", "4.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the first applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable, which sum to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement, simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "5.  Dismisses the remainder of the first applicant's claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 9 December 2010, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tClaudia Westerdiek\tPeer Lorenzen\n\tRegistrar\tPresident"]}
