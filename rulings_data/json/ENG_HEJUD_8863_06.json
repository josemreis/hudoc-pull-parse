In that report the post office mentioned that the register of delivered mail containing the applicant's signature in that connection had been destroyed and that a copy of it was not available.", "10.  The applicant stated that neither she nor her lawyer had been informed of the hearing on appeal in advance.

They requested the Court to strike the application out of its list of cases on the ground that the applicant had abused the right of petition.", "29.  The applicant disagreed.", "30.  The Court reiterates that, except in extraordinary cases, an application may only be rejected as abusive if it was knowingly based on untrue facts (see, for instance, Varbanov v. Bulgaria, no. 31365/96, § 36, ECHR 2000-X).", "31.  In the present case, regard being had to the parties' submissions and other material in the Court's possession, the question of whether the applicant was informed of the hearing on appeal remains undetermined. Thus, the Court is unable to conclude that the applicant has knowingly based her allegations of the failure of the Court of Appeal to inform her of that hearing on untrue information (see Popov v.  (no. 1), no. 74153/01, § 45, 18 January 2005; and Daniliuc v. Moldova, no. 46581/99, § 32, 18 October 2005). Accordingly, the Court discerns no indication that the applicant abused her right of petition, within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention, and dismisses the Government's preliminary objection.", "32.  The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  Submissions of the parties", "33.  The applicant complained of lack of access to a court. She argued that the Supreme Court had disregarded the fact that she had missed the time-limit for lodging an appeal in cassation because of the failure of the Court of Appeal to inform her of the hearing on 17 August2005 and to send her a copy of its decisions in accordance with Article 216 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1963, which had been applicable to the proceedings on appeal by virtue of the provisions of Article 302 of that Code.", "34.  The Government stated that there had been no violation of Article 6 of the Convention in the applicant's case. In particular, they submitted that the applicant had been duly informed of the hearing on appeal on 17 August 2005 and had been able to request the adjournment of that hearing, that her lawyer had also been aware of that hearing, which was confirmed by his request of 7 September 2005, and that after the hearing of 17 August 2005 the decision of the Court of Appeal together with other materials of the case had been available at that court. On these grounds, the Government contended that the applicant and her lawyer had had a real opportunity to submit an appeal in cassation within the time-limit set by the law.", "35.  The Government further argued that Article 216 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1963 was applicable to the proceedings before the firstinstance courts, and not to the proceedings on appeal.", "36.  According to the Government, the Supreme Court's refusal to allow the applicant's request to renew the time-limit for lodging her appeal in cassation had been based on the above-mentioned considerations.", "2.  The Court's assessment", "37.  The Court reiterates that the right to a court, of which the right of access is one aspect, is not absolute; it may be subject to limitations permitted by implication, particularly regarding the conditions of admissibility of an appeal. However, these limitations must not restrict the exercise of the right in such a way or to such an extent that its very essence is impaired. They must pursue a legitimate aim and there must be a reasonable degree of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved.", "38.  The rules on time-limits for appeals are undoubtedly designed to ensure the proper administration of justice and legal certainty. Those concerned must expect those rules to be applied. However, the rules in question, or the application of them, should themselves correspond to the principle of legal certainty and should not prevent litigants from making use of an available remedy (see Melnyk v. Ukraine, no. 23436/03, §§ 22-23, 28 March 2006).", "39.  The Court notes that, according to its established case-law concerning , the above guarantees enshrined in Article 6 are applicable to proceedings before courts of cassation in civil matters (see Melnyk, cited above, § 25).", "40.  Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court observes that the applicant had access to a court of cassation, in that her appeal reached the Supreme Court. However, it was not considered because the latter court found that it had been lodged out of time and that the applicant's request for the renewal of the time-limit was unfounded.", "41.  Although the applicant contended that the decision of the Supreme Court had been unlawful, the Court does not find it necessary to examine whether the relevant rules were accurately applied by that court. The latter was definitely better placed to interpret the domestic rules of procedure, in particular those concerning procedural time-limits. Nevertheless, the Court considers that it is necessary to examine whether their application in the present cases could be regarded as foreseeable from the point of view of the applicants (see Melnyk, cited above, § 26).", "42.  In this context, the Court notes that under the provisions of Article 216 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1963, read in the light of Article 302 of that Code, the applicant was entitled to be served ex officio with a written copy of the decision of the Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 19-20 above). This is indirectly confirmed by the amended provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure of 2004 concerning the same procedural matter (see paragraphs 23-24 above). The Government's submissions to the contrary are not supported by any evidence or persuasive arguments.", "43.  Therefore, the applicant, who and whose lawyer had not actually been present at the hearing on appeal, had legitimate grounds to expect a copy of the decision on appeal to be sent to her within the five-day timelimit enabling her to prepare and submit an appeal in cassation.", "44.  In these circumstances, the question of whether the applicant or her lawyer knew about that hearing in advance does not appear to be directly relevant for the examination of the applicant's complaint.", "45.  The Court further notes that the applicant's lawyer inquired about the decision on appeal within a relatively short period of time (see paragraph 13 above). Although the one-month time-limit had not expired when he learnt of the decision of 17 August 2005, the lawyer and the applicant had to wait for a copy of that decision, which the lawyer immediately requested, in order to prepare a cassation appeal. Having obtained a copy of the impugned decision on 5 October 2005, the applicant could have reasonably expected the one-month time-limit to have been brought forward to 6 November 2005, as there were no specific rules setting a procedure to be followed in such situation.", "46.  The Court notes that the applicant submitted an appeal in cassation within less than a month and the entire period which lapsed after the delivery of the impugned decision was far from reaching the one-year maximum period set by Article 321 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1963 and by Article 325 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 2004 (see paragraphs 21 above). In her submissions before the Supreme Court the applicant gave reasons for missing the time-limit and requested its extension.", "47.  On the whole, the Court finds that the applicant and her lawyer acted with due diligence in the case and that it was not the applicant's fault that she did not submit an appeal in cassation within the original time-limit set by the law. Even assuming that the Government's explanations as to the reasons for the Supreme Court's refusal to renew the time-limit are accurate, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the case the application of procedural limitations by the domestic court was not clear and foreseeable from the applicant's point of view and thus was not in compliance with the principle of legal certainty.", "There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "II.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "48.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", " “If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "49.  The applicant claimed 5,000 euros (EUR) in respect of nonpecuniary damage.", "50.  The Government contended that the claim was unsubstantiated.", "51.  The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered some distress and anxiety on account of the violation of her right of access to a court. Ruling on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, it awards her EUR 2,000 under this head.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "52.  The applicant made no claim as to costs and expenses. Therefore, the Court makes no award under this head.", "C.  Default interest", "53.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT", "1.  Declares the application admissible;", "", "2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;", "", "3.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "4.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 18 November 2010, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tStephen Phillips\tPeer Lorenzen\n\tDeputy Registrar\tPresident"]}
