In August 1995 he was called up for military service. From September 1995 he was repeatedly convicted of having set other persons against the institution of military service, of having refused to wear uniform or of having deserted; as a result, he was sentenced to imprisonment on several occasions. Each time he was released, he was sent back to his unit and again convicted on account of his persistent refusal to wear uniform. Under the domestic legislation, all male citizens are obliged to follow at least a period of basic training, failing which they are liable to imprisonment. No other form of service is available to conscientious objectors.", "Admissible under Article 9, the question of this Article’s applicability being joined to the merits.
