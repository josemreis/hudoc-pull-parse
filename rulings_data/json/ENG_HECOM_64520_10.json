It was argued that Mr K. had been active in informing the security service and demanding intransigent policies and had had collegial contacts with State security, without being an agent.", "In the article, Mr Ungváry relied inter alia on material archived by the security service as a “strictly confidential action plan”, which described the role played by leaders of  – including Mr K., deputy secretary of the local party committee between 1983 and 1988 – in assisting the security operations. Mr Ungváry characterised Mr K.’s attitude in the Dialógus case as that of a ‘hardliner’, in comparison to other senior staff. To illustrate this label, Mr Ungváry recalled that Mr K. had ordered the removal of Dialógus’s poster saying that “the country needed no such organisation”, that he had reproached a candidate in the Communist youth organisation’s elections having been supported by Dialógus; moreover, in Mr Ungváry’s view, Mr K.’s hardline stance was proved by the style of the information notes drafted by Mr K. for the security services.", "Mr K. filed a criminal complaint against Mr Ungváry on charges of libel.

It found for Mr K., holding that his personality rights were violated by the false impression, given by the article in question, that he had been a security agent and an infiltrator during Communist times, collaborated with the security agencies and written reports for them, countered the above-mentioned youth organisation official’s election on the secret service’s inspiration and demanded hardline policies in 1983.", "The applicants, jointly and severally, were obliged to pay damages in the amount of some 7,100 euros (EUR), whereas Mr Ungváry had to pay another EUR 3,500. The legal costs to be borne by the applicants amounted to approximately EUR 3,300, not including the applicants’ own legal expenses.", "COMPLAINT", "The applicants complain under Article 10 of the Convention that the Hungarian courts’ finding against them amounted to a violation of their right to freedom of expression, especially in view of the facts that the publication in question was an essay on important questions of contemporary history, concerned the background of a senior public official, and contained value-laden statements of fact, not susceptible to proving their truthfulness, and that the sanction imposed was disproportionately burdensome.", "QUESTION TO THE PARTIES", "In view of the Court’s recent case-law on the subject (see AxelSpringer AG v.  [GC], no. 39954/08, 7 February 2012; Von Hannover v.
