The applicant was prohibited from re‑entering Ukraine after his ex-wife filed a complaint against him. She then began proceedings to deprive him of his parental rights with respect to their son. Due to the prohibition on re-entry the applicant was unable to take part in the proceedings and was eventually deprived of his parental rights. His representative appealed unsuccessfully.", "Law: The proceedings concerning parental rights had to be based on an assessment of the applicant's personal character and his behaviour. Such an assessment could not be undertaken without having heard the applicant in person or at least, in the circumstances of the present case, having sought to obtain first‑hand information from the applicant as to the events and his relations with his son and ex-wife, via international legal assistance instruments. This was not done in the instant case. Further, the domestic courts disregarded the fact that the applicant had attempted to see his son, they failed to call a witness proposed by the applicant, and the respective higher courts did not answer the applicant's complaints about these failures. Moreover, the fact that the applicant contested the request for deprivation of his parental rights could also be seen as evidence of his interest in his son. In sum, the applicant was not involved in the decision-making process to an extent necessary to protect his interests.", "Conclusion: violation (unanimously) and no need to examine the facts also under Article 6(1) (fair hearing).", "Article 41 – EUR 10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the ", ""]}
