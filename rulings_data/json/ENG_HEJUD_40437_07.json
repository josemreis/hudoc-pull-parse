Therefore, the failure of the applicant’s constitutional complaint in no way impaired his chances of success under the State Liability Act.", "55.  As to the substance, the Government admitted that “doubts [might] arise as to the efficiency of the lower courts in handling the contested proceedings”. Nevertheless, in their submission, the overall length of the proceedings was influenced by the applicant’s and his lawyer’s procedural behaviour.", "56.  The applicant disagreed and reiterated his complaint. In particular, he submitted that it was not appropriate to require of him the exhaustion of any further remedies 11 years after the introduction of his action. Referring to the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 25 October 1995 in the case no. II. ÚS 26/95 (see paragraph 45 above), where it was held specifically that a complaint to the president of the court was not a prerequisite of a constitutional recourse in respect of excessive length of judicial proceedings, and to the Constitutional Court’ decision of 11 June 2009 (see paragraph 46 above) in one of his own unrelated cases, where no complaint to the president of the court in question had been required for the purposes of his constitutional complaint, the applicant concluded that there was no established practice on the part of the Constitutional Court in that respect.", "57.  As to a claim for damages under the State Liability Act, the applicant submitted inter alia that such a claim would be directed against and entertained by the same court which compromised any prospects of success that it might hypothetically have. In addition, it would generate further litigation without solving the essence of the problem, which was the length of the proceedings in the action that he had lodged in 2001.", "(b) The Court’s assessment", "58.  The Court considers that, in the present case, the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention raises issues which are closely linked to the merits of the applicants’ complaints and that it would be more appropriately examined at the merits stage.", "59.  At the same time, the Court considers, in the light of the parties’ submissions, that the complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention raises serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. The Court concludes therefore that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established. It must accordingly be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  Applicable general principles", "60.  Under Article 1 of the Convention, which provides that “[t]he High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention”, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Articles 13 and 35 § 1 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, § 38, ECHR 2006 V).", "61.  The purpose of Article 35 § 1, which sets out the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies, is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, among other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 74, ECHR 1999-V). The rule in Article 35 § 1 is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 (with which it has close affinity), that there is an effective domestic remedy available in respect of the alleged breach of an individual’s Convention rights (see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 152, ECHR 2000-XI).", "62.  Nevertheless, the only remedies which Article 35 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among other authorities, Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, § 142, ECHR 2006 V).", "63.  Remedies available to a litigant at domestic level for raising a complaint about the length of proceedings are “effective” within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention if they prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred. A remedy is therefore effective if it can be used either to expedite a decision by the courts dealing with the case, or to provide the litigant with adequate redress for delays that have already occurred (see Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, § 17, ECHR 2002-VIII).", "64.  However, as the Court emphasised, the best solution in absolute terms is indisputably, as in many spheres, prevention. Where the judicial system is deficient with regard to the reasonable-time requirement in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution. Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy. Some States have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation (see Sürmeli v. Germany [GC], no. 75529/01, § 100, ECHR 2006 VII, with further references).", "65.  Where a domestic legal system has made provision for bringing an action against the State, the Court has pointed out that such an action must remain an effective, sufficient and accessible remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings and that its sufficiency may be affected by excessive delays and depend on the level of compensation (see Sürmeli, cited above, § 101, with further references).", "2.  Relevant Convention case-law in respect of ", "66.  Until constitutional amendment no. 90/2001 Coll., there were no effective remedies within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in  in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings. The effectiveness of the following remedies was not accepted for the purposes of that provision: a petition under what was then Article 130 of the Constitution (see, for example, Bánošová v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 38798/97, 27 April 2000), a complaint under the State Administration of Courts Act (see, for example, Molnárová and Kochanová v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 44965/98, 4 March 2003) and an action for damages under the State Liability Act 1969 (see, for example, Švolík v. Slovakia, no. 51545/99, §§ 37-38, 15 February 2005).", "67.  Under constitutional amendment no. 90/2001 Coll., a new remedy was established, a complaint under the amended Article 127 of the Constitution (Constitutional Law no. 460/1992 Coll., as amended) (see paragraphs 15 and 11 above), which is in general considered to be a remedy to be used for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the excessive length of proceedings (see, for example, Andrášik and Others v. Slovakia (dec.), nos. 57984/00, 60237/00, 60242/00, 60679/00, 60680/00, 68563/01 and 60226/00, ECHR 2002 IX).", "68.  In its decision in the application of Bako v. Slovakia (no. 60227/00, 15 March 2005), the Court acknowledged that, when dealing with complaints under Article 127 of the Constitution in respect of the length of proceedings, the Constitutional Court’s practice was to examine separately the segments of those proceedings taking place before different courts. This practice stemmed from the need for the  to identify separately the authorities which might be liable for a violation of the complainant’s human rights and fundamental freedoms and which, as the case may be, it would then order to provide appropriate redress to the person concerned. In the Court’s decision in Bako (cited above), it was also noted that this approach was different from that of the Court, which consists in examining the overall length of the proceedings. In this connection the Court wishes to clarify that an examination of the overall length of the proceedings does not preclude that a particular attention be given to a specific segment of the proceedings taking place before a specific court.", "69.  In its decision in Bako (cited above), the Court found that it therefore had to satisfy itself in each individual case whether the protection of a person’s right granted by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic was comparable to that which the Court could provide under the Convention. In cases concerning the length of proceedings this requirement will only be met where the Constitutional Court’s decision, while structured so as to make a separate assessment of each of the individual stages of proceedings, is capable of covering all stages of the proceedings complained of and thus, in the same way as decisions given by the Court, of taking into account their overall length.", "70.  Consequently, it was found that, in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, applicants had to have formulated their complaints under Article 127 of the Constitution in a way that would allow the Constitutional Court to examine the overall length of the proceedings in issue (see Obluk v. Slovakia, no. 69484/01, § 62, 20 June 2006).", "71.  The Court has also acknowledged the Constitutional Court’s practice of entertaining complaints under Article 127 of the Constitution about the length of proceedings only where the proceedings complained about are pending before the authority liable for the alleged violation at the time such complaints are lodged (see Obluk, cited above, § 51) and it has held that, for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, applicants had to have introduced their constitutional complaints in accordance with this practice (see Mazurek v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 16970/05, 3 March 2009).", "72.  Reaffirming the importance of the protection afforded to applicants in each individual case at the national level being comparable to that afforded by the Court under the Convention, as specified in paragraph 71 above, the Court acknowledged that it is first of all for the national authorities to devise means and methods of examining individual complaints so as to render the protection of their rights effective (see Michalák v. Slovakia, no. 30157/03, §§ 176-77, 8 February 2011).", "3.  Assessment of the present case", "73.  The Court reiterates that it is not its role to decide in the abstract whether the applicable domestic law is compatible with the Convention or whether the domestic law has been complied with by the national authorities. In cases arising from individual petitions it must as far as possible examine the issues raised by the case before it. The question of exhaustion of domestic remedies will therefore now be examined with reference to the specific circumstances of the present case only (see, for example, Jakub v. Slovakia, no. 2015/02, § 48, 28 February 2006, with further references).", "(a) Complaint under the Courts Act", "74.  The Court considers that, strictly speaking, the essential question to be answered is not whether a complaint under the Courts Act is effective within the meaning of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention as such, but rather whether the applicant has complied with the exhaustion requirement under that Article.", "75.  From that perspective, the Court reiterates that in Slovakia, in respect of the excessive length of proceedings, the remedy that is normally considered to be effective and that accordingly has to be used for the purposes of the domestic remedies rule under the Convention is the complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution (see Andrášik and Others, cited above).", "76.  The Court observes that the applicant in the present case made three separate submissions aimed at the length of proceedings. These applications were made on 24 and 26 March 2003 and 17 July 2004 (see paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 above) and were phrased in general term and without specifying any particular set of proceedings. Their vagueness in combination with the number of court proceedings involving the applicant before the courts concerned was the reason why the  found that these applications did not amount to a valid complaint under the Courts Act (see paragraphs 18 above).", "77.  In this context, although it is not decisive, the Court finds it useful to reiterate that lodging a complaint of delays in proceedings to the president of the court concerned under the State Administration of Courts Act, which was comparable to a complaint under the Courts Act (see paragraph 26 above), has been found not to be an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 61 above).", "The Court also finds it useful to reiterate that, when examining complaints about the length of proceedings, the president of the court concerned acts in the capacity of manager rather than in a judicial capacity (see paragraph 28 above and also DMD GROUP, a.s. v. Slovakia, no. 19334/03, §§ 40, 41 and 65, 5 October 2010).", "78.  At this juncture the Court reiterates that, for a remedy to be “effective” for Convention purposes, it has to allow prevention of the alleged violation or its continuation, or to provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see paragraph 60 above). While, in respect of lengthy proceedings, a preventive measure is preferable, if a length-of-proceedings violation has already occurred, a remedy designed only to expedite them may not be adequate, and compensation or another form of redress may be called for (see Cocchiarella, cited above, §§ 74-77).", "79.  The Court notes that a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution is precisely aimed at allowing redress of both a preventive and compensatory nature (see Andrášik and Others, cited above).", "80.  However, the ultimate effect for an applicant may change when the availability of redress under Article 127 of the Constitution becomes dependent on a complaint under the Courts Act, the latter having no compensatory potential. In this context it is to be noted that, before the , the applicant claimed compensation in the amount of some EUR 4,350 (see paragraph 17 above), that a complaint under the Courts Act could at most bring about acceleration of the proceedings, but that there was no scope for any such compensation claim in connection with it.", "81.  In these circumstances, the Court has to examine the overall effectiveness, from the point of view of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, of the combination of remedies available to the applicant.", "82.  As to the functional relationship between a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution and a complaint under the Courts Act, the Court notes the explanations provided by the Government, in particular their reliance on the Constitutional Court’s report of 7 June 2010 (see paragraphs 34 et seq. above), submitting that:", "- a complaint under the Courts Act is in general a remedy to be used before a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution can be made;", "- making use of a complaint under the Courts Act is, however, not required in cases where the length of proceedings is “extreme” and “manifestly disproportionate”, provided that the complainant had actively been seeking their acceleration;", "- the complaint under the Courts Act cannot be considered as having been duly used if it was lodged at the same time as a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution, after its introduction, or if the latter was introduced too early after the reply of the president of the court in question to the former.", "83.  The Court observes that, rather than stemming directly from decisions and judgments of the Constitutional Court, this summary of the Constitutional Court’s practice was drawn up post factum and at an administrative level and that, although being certainly of informative value, it has no normative implications for the facts of the present case which preceded it.", "84.  Furthermore, and in any event, the Court cannot but note certain incongruities in the Constitutional Court’s case-law relied on by the Government on the one hand and known to the Court otherwise on the other hand.", "In particular, the Court notes that there appears to be a number of cases which were admitted by the Constitutional Court for examination on the merits without the complainants’ having used a complaint under the Courts Act, one of such cases involving the present applicant himself (see paragraph 46 above). At the same time, it has to be noted that the Constitutional Court’s decisions in these cases contain no analysis of the exhaustion of remedies question. In particular, they contain nothing to support the Government’s argument which may be understood as proposing that there are distinct exhaustion rules in respect of certain categories of length-of-proceedings cases.", "85.  Furthermore the Court notes the Constitutional Court’s specific pronouncement that a complaint under the State Administration of Courts Act was not required prior to a length-of-proceedings claim before the . The Court is aware that this pronouncement was made with reference to the constitutional framework before the amendment providing for the present complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution (see paragraph 65 above). However, the Court observes that no argument has been advanced by the Government or established in the Constitutional Court’s caselaw or otherwise as to why the considerations underlying that pronouncement should not apply mutatis mutandis in respect of the otherwise similar complaint under the Courts Act within the framework of the current Article 127 of the Constitution.", "86.  In addition, the Court observes that the impugned decision of the  in the present case (see paragraph 18 above) concerned proceedings, the length of which had been more than 6 years over 2 levels of jurisdiction. The Court finds it questionable wherever, at that stage, a remedy of no more than a preventive nature would have been adequate for the Convention purposes (see Cocchiarella, cited above, §§ 74-77).", "87.  Finally, the Court observes that a complaint under the Courts Act is by definition linked to the court concerned, whereas the Court’s approach is to examine the overall length of the proceedings (see Bako, cited above). It is therefore unclear how such examination could be obtained from the  if the proceedings in question take place before several courts and the complaint under the Courts Act is to be brought to the president of each of those courts.", "88.  In view of the above considerations the Court concludes that the applicant cannot be reproached under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention for the way in which he used the remedy under Article 127 of the Constitution in the specific circumstances of his case.", "(b) Claim for damages under the State Liability Act", "89.  As for any remedies under the State Liability Act, the Court reiterates first of all that where there is a choice of remedies, the exhaustion requirement must be applied to reflect the practical realities of an applicant’s position, so as to ensure the effective protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention. Moreover, an applicant who has used a remedy which is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried others that were available but probably no more likely to be successful (see Karlin v. Slovakia, no. 41238/05, § 85, 28 June 2011, with further references).", "90.  As has been noted above, in the present case, the applicant sought protection of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time before the  under Article 127 of the Constitution.", "91.  The Constitutional Court, as the supreme authority for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Slovakia, had jurisdiction to examine the applicant’s complaint and to afford them redress if appropriate (see, mutatis mutandis, Lawyer Partners a.s. v. Slovakia, nos. 54252/07, 3274/08, 3377/08, 3505/08, 3526/08, 3741/08, 3786/08, 3807/08, 3824/08, 15055/08, 29548/08, 29551/08, 29552/08, 29555/08 and 29557/08, § 45, ECHR 2009-..., with further references).", "92.  As the Court has equally acknowledged above, the course of action chosen by the applicant in this case is normally considered to be effective for the purposes of the domestic remedies rule under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. Moreover, there is nothing in the Constitutional Court’s decision to suggest that the applicant’s constitutional complaint was not admissible because he had not made use of the remedy now relied on by the Government.", "93.  In these circumstances, the Court cannot but find that the applicant’s course of action as to the remedies used was reasonable and appropriate (see Karlin, cited above, § 88, with further references).", "94.  Furthermore, and in any event, the Court notes that the Government have not shown that the remedy under the State Liability Act has ever been used with success in a situation comparable to that of the applicant.", "95.  Accordingly, the Court finds that the applicant is not required to have had recourse to the remedy under the State Liability Act, as referred to by the Government.", "4.  Conclusion", "96.  In view of the above consideration the Court concludes that the Government’s preliminary objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed.", "97.  The period to be taken into consideration began on 9 January 2001 and has not ended yet. It has thus far lasted more than 11 years and 3 months for three levels of the ordinary courts.", "98.  The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of this period must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, § 43, ECHR 2000-VII).", "99.  The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).", "100.  Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the “reasonable time” requirement.", "There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 § 1.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION", "101.  The applicant further complained that he had not had at his disposal an effective remedy in respect of their complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”", "A.  Admissibility", "102.  The Court notes that this complaint is linked to the one examined above and must therefore likewise be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "103.  Referring to their arguments as mentioned above, the Government argued that the applicant had had at his disposal remedies under the Courts Act, the State Liability Act and, ultimately, Article 127 of the Constitution, which, taken together, were compatible with the requirements of Article 13 of the Convention.", "104.  In reply, the applicant argued that the only remedy he had had which in principle was “effective” for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention was a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution and that, on the specific facts of his case this remedy had failed.", "105.  The Court reiterates that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief. The effectiveness of a remedy within the meaning of Article 13 does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant. Also, even if a single remedy does not by itself entirely satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies provided for under domestic law may do so. It is therefore necessary to determine in each case whether the means available to litigants in domestic law are “effective” in the sense either of preventing the alleged violation or its continuation, or of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see, for example, Sürmeli, cited above, § 98).", "106.  In the present case, in view of the Court’s finding under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 100 above), the complaint under that provision must be considered “arguable” for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention.", "107.  The Court further refers to its finding that the applicant was not required for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention to assert his rights under the State Liability Act, inter alia, on the ground that there is no precedent indicating that its use has been successful in a comparable situation (see paragraphs 94 and 95 above).", "108.  Furthermore, the Court observes that the remedy in question is compensatory in nature and that there is no indication that it may give rise to an order for the acceleration of the proceedings.", "109.  At the same time, the Court also notes that the use by the applicant of the other available remedies has been futile.", "110.  It follows that, in the specific circumstances of the present case, the applicant did not have an effective remedy in respect of his complaint about the length of the proceedings.", "There has accordingly been a violation of Article 13, in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "III.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "111.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "112.  The applicant claimed EUR 200 in respect of pecuniary damage allegedly caused by the defendant of his action to his property and EUR 33,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "113.  The Government contested the former claim in principle and the latter claim as to the amount.", "114.  The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, it awards the applicant EUR 3,000 in respect of nonpecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "115.  The applicant also claimed a lump sum of EUR 2,000 for all costs and expenses.", "116.  The Government contested the claim arguing that the applicant had failed to support it by any documents.", "117.  According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum (see, for example, Iatridis v. Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 31107/96, § 54, ECHR 2000-XI). Furthermore, Rule 60 § 2 of the Rules of Court provides that itemised particulars of any claim made under Article 41 of the Convention must be submitted, together with the relevant supporting documents or vouchers, failing which the Court may reject the claim in whole or in part.", "118.  In the instant case, the Court observes that the applicant has not substantiated his claim by any relevant supporting documents. Accordingly, the Court decides not to award any sum under this head.", "C.  Default interest", "119.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT", "1.  Decides by a majority to join to the merits the Government’s objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies concerning the complaint under the Courts Act;", "", "2.  Declares by a majority the complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention concerning the excessive length of the proceedings and the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention of the lack of an effective remedy in that respect admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;", "", "3.  Holds by five votes to two that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;", "", "4.  Holds by five votes to two that there has been a violation of Article 13, in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;", "", "5.  Holds by five votes to two", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "6.  Dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 12 June 2012, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tSantiago Quesada\tJosep Casadevall\n\tRegistrar\tPresident", "In accordance with Article 45 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 § 2 of the Rules of Court, the separate opinion of Judges López Guerra and Gyulumyan is annexed to this judgment.", "J.C.M.\nS.Q.", "DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE LÓPEZ GUERRA JOINED BY JUDGE GYULUMYAN", "For the same reasons as those stated in my dissenting opinion in the case of Ištván and Ištvánová v. Slovakia (no. 30189/07), I am unable to support the majority’s conclusion as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies in the present case.", ""]}
