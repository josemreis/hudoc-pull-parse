The relevant extracts read as follows:", "Introduction.", "“... Two resolutions of the International Labour Conference itself – which provide guidelines for ILO policy – in one way or another emphasized recognition of the right to strike in member States. The “Resolution concerning the Abolition of Anti-Trade Union Legislation in the States Members of the International Labour Organisation”, adopted in 1957, called for the adoption of “laws ... ensuring the effective and unrestricted exercise of trade union rights, including the right to strike, by the workers ” (ILO, 1957, p. 783). Similarly, the “Resolution concerning Trade Union Rights and Their Relation to Civil Liberties”, adopted in 1970, invited the Governing Body to instruct the Director-General to take action in a number of ways “with a view to considering further action to ensure full and universal respect for trade union rights in their broadest sense”, with particular attention to be paid, inter alia, to the “right to strike” (ILO, 1970, pp. 735-736). The right to strike has also been affirmed in various resolutions of the ILO’s regional conferences and industrial committees, as well as by other international bodies (see Hodges-Aeberhard and Odero, 1987, pp. 543 and 545). ...", "1. General issues.", "The basic principle of the right to strike.", "“From its very earliest days, during its second meeting, in 1952, the Committee on Freedom of Association declared strike action to be a right and laid down the basic principle underlying this right, from which all others to some extent derive, and which recognizes the right to strike to be one of the principal means by which workers and their associations may legitimately promote and defend their economic and social interests (ILO, 1996d, paras. 473-475). Over the years, in line with this principle, the Committee on Freedom of Association has recognized that strike action is a right and not simply a social act, and has also:", "1. made it clear it is a right which workers and their organizations (trade unions, federations and confederations) are entitled to enjoy ...;", "2. reduced the number of categories of workers who may be deprived of this right, as well as the legal restrictions on its exercise, which should not be excessive;", "3. linked the exercise of the right to strike to the objective of promoting and defending the economic and social interests of workers ...;", "4. stated that the legitimate exercise of the right to strike should not entail prejudicial penalties of any sort, which would imply acts of anti-union discrimination.", "These views expressed by the Committee on Freedom of Association coincide in substance with those of the Committee of Experts. ...", "3.  Workers who enjoy the right to strike and those who are excluded.", "It should be noted, first and foremost, that Article 9 of Convention No. 87 states that “the extent to which the guarantees provided for in this Convention shall apply to the armed forces and the police shall be determined by national laws or regulations” (ILO, 1996a, p. 528). As a result, the Committee on Freedom of Association has refused to find an objection to legislations which deny the right to strike to such groups of workers.", "Since the Committee on Freedom of Association first laid down its earliest principles on the subject of strikes, and given that strike action is one of the fundamental means for rendering effective the right of workers’ organizations “to organize their ... activities” (Article 3 of Convention No. 87), the Committee has chosen to recognize a general right to strike, with the sole possible exceptions being those which may be imposed for public servants and workers in essential services in the strict sense of the term. Obviously, the Committee on Freedom of Association also accepts the prohibition of strikes in the event of an acute national emergency (ILO, 1996d, para. 527). ...", "Essential services in the strict sense of the term", "Over time, the supervisory bodies of the ILO have brought greater precision to the concept of essential services in the strict sense of the term (for which strike action may be prohibited). In 1983, the Committee of Experts defined such services as those “the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population” (ILO, 1983b, para. 214). This definition was adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association shortly afterwards.", "Clearly, what is meant by essential services in the strict sense of the term “depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a country”; likewise, there can be no doubt that “a non-essential service may become essential if a strike lasts beyond a certain time or extends beyond a certain scope, thus endangering the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population” (ILO, 1996d, para. 541). The Committee on Freedom of Association has none the less given its opinion in a general manner on the essential or non-essential nature of a series of specific services.", "Thus, the Committee has considered to be essential services in the strict sense, where the right to strike may be subject to major restrictions or even prohibitions, to be: the hospital sector; electricity services; water supply services; the telephone service; air traffic control (ibid., para. 544).", "In contrast, the Committee has considered that, in general the following do not constitute essential services in the strict sense of the term, and therefore the prohibition to strike does not pertain (ibid., para 545):", "• radio and television; • the petroleum sector; • ports (loading and unloading); • banking; • computer services for the collection of excise duties and taxes; • department stores; • pleasure parks; • the metal sector; • the mining sector; • transport generally; • refrigeration enterprises; • hotel services; • construction; • automobile manufacturing; • aircraft repairs; • agricultural activities; • the supply and distribution of foodstuffs; • the Mint; • the government printing service; • the state alcohol, salt and tobacco monopolies; • the education sector; • metropolitan transport; • postal services.", "These few examples do not represent an exhaustive list of essential services. The Committee has not mentioned more services because its opinion is dependent on the nature of the specific situations and on the context which it has to examine and because complaints are rarely submitted regarding the prohibition of strikes in essential services.", "Obviously, the Committee on Freedom of Association’s list of non-essential services is not exhaustive.", "Attention should in all events be drawn to the fact that, in examining a complaint which did not involve an essential service, the Committee maintained that the possible long-term serious consequences for the national economy of a strike did not justify its prohibition (ILO, 1984b, 234th Report, para. 190).", "Furthermore, pursuant to its examination of particular national legislations, the Committee on Freedom of Association has recommended that amendments should be introduced in order to prohibit only strikes in the essential services in the strict sense of the term, particularly when the authorities have held discretionary powers to extend the list of essential services (ILO, 1984a, 233rd Report, paras. 668 and 669).", "The Committee of Experts, for its part, has stated the following:", "“Numerous countries have provisions prohibiting or limiting strikes in essential services, a concept which varies from one national legislation to another. They may range from merely a relatively short limitative enumeration to a long list which is included in the law itself. Sometimes the law includes definitions, from the most restrictive to the most general kind, covering all activities which the government may consider appropriate to include or strikes which it deems detrimental to public order, the general interest or economic development. In extreme cases, the legislation provides that a mere statement to this effect by the authorities suffices to justify the essential nature of the service. The principle whereby the right to strike may be limited or even prohibited in essential services would lose all meaning if national legislation defined these services in too broad a manner. As an exception to the general principle of the right to strike, the essential services in which this principle may be entirely or partly waived should be defined restrictively: the Committee therefore considers that essential services are only those the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population.", "Furthermore, it is of the opinion that it would not be desirable – or even possible — to attempt to draw up a complete and fixed list of services which can be considered as essential.", "While recalling the fundamental importance which it attaches to the universal nature of standards, the Committee considers that account must be taken of the special circumstances existing in the various member States, since the interruption of certain services which in some countries might at worst cause economic hardship could prove disastrous in other countries and rapidly lead to conditions which might endanger the life, personal safety and health of the population. A strike in the port or maritime transport services, for example, might more rapidly cause serious disruptions for an island which is heavily dependent on such services to provide basic supplies to its population than it would for a country on a continent. Furthermore, a non-essential service in the strict sense of the term may become essential if the strike affecting it exceeds a certain duration or extent so that the life, personal safety or health of the population are endangered (for example, in household refuse collection services). In order to avoid damages which are irreversible or out of all proportion to the occupational interests of the parties to the dispute, as well as damages to third parties, namely the users or consumers who suffer the economic effects of collective disputes, the authorities could establish a system of minimum service in other services which are of public utility (“services d’utilité publique”) rather than impose an outright ban on strikes, which should be limited to essential services in the strict sense of the term (ILO, 1994a, paras. 159 and 160).”", "Terminological clarification regarding the concept of essential service and minimum service", "... it would be useful to clarify particular terminological points, since a full understanding of the supervisory bodies’ principles regarding the so-called essential services may otherwise not be assured. In some countries, the concept of essential services is used in legislation to refer to services in which strikes are not prohibited but where a minimum operational service may be required; in other countries, the idea of essential services is used to justify substantial restrictions, and even prohibition of strike action. When formulating their principles, the ILO supervisory bodies define the expression “essential services” in the latter sense. They also employ an intermediate concept, between essential services (where strikes may be prohibited) and nonessential services (where they may not be prohibited), which is that of services of “fundamental importance” (Committee on Freedom of Association terminology) or of “public utility” (Committee of Experts terminology), where the ILO supervisory bodies consider that strikes may not be banned but a system of minimum service may be imposed for the operation of the undertaking or institution in question. In this regard, the Committee of Experts has stated that, because of the diversity of terms used in national legislation and texts on the subject, some confusion has sometimes arisen between the concepts of minimum service and essential services; they must therefore be defined very clearly.", "When the Committee of Experts uses the expression “essential services” it refers only to essential services in the strict sense of the term (i.e. those the interruption of which would endanger the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population), in which restrictions or even a prohibition may be justified, accompanied, however, by compensatory guarantees. Nevertheless, a “minimum service” “would be appropriate in situations in which a substantial restriction or total prohibition of strike action would not appear to be justified and where, without calling into question the right to strike of the large majority of workers, one might consider ensuring that users’ basic needs are met and that facilities operate safely or without interruption” (ibid., para. 162). Specifically, the Committee considers this type of minimum service might be established in services of public utility (ibid., para. 179). Indeed, “nothing prevents authorities, if they consider that such a solution is more appropriate to national conditions, from establishing only a minimum service in sectors considered as ‘essential’ by the supervisory bodies according to the criteria set forth above, which justify wider restrictions to or even a prohibition of strikes” (ibid., para. 162). ...”", "3.  European Social Charter (revised)", "Article 6 – The right to bargain collectively", "“With a view to ensuring the effective exercise of the right to bargain collectively, the Contracting Parties undertake:", "1. to promote joint consultation between workers and employers;", "2. to promote, where necessary and appropriate, machinery for voluntary negotiations between employers or employers’ organisations and workers’ organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements;", "3. to promote the establishment and use of appropriate machinery for conciliation and voluntary arbitration for the settlement of labour disputes;", "and recognise:", "4. the right of workers and employers to collective action in cases of conflicts of interest, including the right to strike, subject to obligations that might arise out of collective agreements previously entered into.”", "Article 31 – Restrictions", "“The rights and principles set forth in Part I when effectively realised, and their effective exercise as provided for in Part II, shall not be subject to any restrictions or limitations not specified in those parts, except such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others or for the protection of public interest, national security, public health, or morals.", "The restrictions permitted under this Charter to the rights and obligations set forth herein shall not be applied for any purpose other than that for which they have been prescribed.”", "Appendix to the Social Charter.", "“Article 6, paragraph 4", "It is understood that each Contracting Party may, insofar as it is concerned, regulate the exercise of the right to strike by law, provided that any further restriction that this might place on the right can be justified under the terms of Article 31.”", "4.  European Committee of Social Rights’ Conclusions in respect of Ukraine, December 2010", "Article 6 - Right to bargain collectively", "Paragraph 4 - Collective action", "“The Committee* takes note of the information contained in the report submitted by Ukraine.", "Article 44 of the Constitution guarantees workers the right to strike to protect their economic and social interests.", "In addition Section 27 of the Law on Trade Unions guarantees the right of trade unions to, inter alia, organise and stage strikes in order to protect workers labour and socioeconomic rights. The Law on the Procedure of settlement of collective disputes contains provisions on the right to strike, including the procedure to be followed prior to exercising the right to strike etc. ...", "Specific restrictions to the right to strike", "Under Article 6 § 4 the right to strike may be restricted provided that any restriction satisfies the conditions laid down in Article G which provides that restrictions on the rights guaranteed by the Charter that are prescribed by law, serve a legitimate purpose and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others or for the protection of public interest, national security, public health or morals.", "Restrictions related to essential service/sectors", "The Committee notes that there are restrictions on the right to strike for workers in the emergency and rescue services, workers at nuclear facilities, workers in underground undertakings as well as workers at electric power engineering enterprises. The Committee recalls that restricting strikes in sectors which are essential to the community is deemed to serve a legitimate purpose since strikes in these sectors could pose a threat to public interest, national security and/or public health. However, simply banning strikes even in essential sectors – particularly when they are extensively defined, is not deemed proportionate to the specific requirements of each sector, but providing for the conformity with Article 6 § 4.", "Therefore the Committee asks for further information on the extent of the restrictions on the right to strike in these sectors, in particular as regards “underground undertakings”.", "In addition the Committee notes that according to the report strikes in the transport sector may be prohibited, inter alia, if the transportation of passengers is affected. The Committee seeks confirmation that this interpretation is correct, in this respect it refers above to its case law mentioned above. ...”", "5.  Report of the PACE Committee on Economic Affairs and Development no. 10546 of 11 May 2005 “The right to strike in essential services: economic implications” – for debate in the Standing Committee", "“...", "3. While there is consensus that the right to strike is an indispensable instrument for the exercise of workers’ economic and social rights, there is an ongoing debate about the need to strike a balance between the protection of these rights and the need to guarantee essential public services in order to safeguard citizens and their well-being. ...", "41. The concept of essential services is now unanimously recognised in Europe, but the term and others like it require some clarification. The Green Paper on services of general interest presented by the Commission of the European Communities in May 2003 gives a number of definitions. Services of general interest cover both market and non-market services which the public authorities class as being of general interest and which are subject to specific public-service obligations. The term services of general economic interest refers to services of an economic nature which EU countries or the Union have chosen to subject to specific public-service obligations by virtue of a general-interest criterion. The concept covers in particular certain services provided by the big network industries such as transport, postal services, energy and communications. The term public service sometimes refers to the fact that a service is provided to the general public or that a particular role has been assigned to it in the general interest. It may also refer to the ownership or status of the entity providing the service. The term public-service obligations generally refers to specific requirements that the public authorities impose on the service provider in order to ensure that certain public-interest objectives are met – for instance, in the areas of air, rail, road transport and energy. ...", "44. Generally speaking in Europe, services considered essential are transport, public broadcasting, water, gas and electricity supply, prison administration, the justice system, national security services, medical care and emergency services. ...", "80. The exercise of the right to strike in essential public services in the Council of Europe member states countries is not only a legal question. With the enlargement of the European Union and liberalisation of certain sectors, it is important to preserve what is a fundamental freedom, and at the same time guarantee real quality of life to every European citizen. Unions, employers and workers alike see strikes as a sign of failure. Only a few months ago (October 2004) a normally consensual country like the  was hit by a strike wave across the whole transport sector. It also involved for example firemen, over plans by the government to cut various social advantages in order to reduce the budget deficit. So the issue is highly topical and even urgent to consider from a European viewpoint. ...”", "6.  PACE Resolution 1442 (2005) “The right to strike in essential services: economic implications” adopted on 6 June 2005", "“1. As Europe undergoes rapid political, economic, social and cultural integration – within the European Union and in the wider Council of Europe area – the vulnerability of each country to disruptions in others is becoming increasingly pronounced. This holds also for strike actions in essential services, whether in public or private ownership, such as in the transport sector (especially air transport), or in public health, at a time of intensified international contacts and labour mobility. The wide differences in national legislation and practices between European countries are, against this background, increasingly at variance with the overall state of European integration and prejudicial to it.", "2. Of further concern is the lack of balance in many countries between, on the one hand, the right to strike, including in essential services, as enshrined in various treaties from the Council of Europe’s revised European Social Charter (ETS No. 163) to the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, and, on the other hand, the fundamental right of citizens to pursue their lives unhindered, preserve their health and well-being, and the right of society to function and to maintain its overall ability to function as well as protect the health and welfare of its citizens.
