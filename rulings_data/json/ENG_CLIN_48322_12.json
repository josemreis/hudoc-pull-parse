A further 400 cases against Hungary concerning the same issue were pending before the Court. It followed that the violations that had been found in the applicant’s case were neither prompted by an isolated incident nor attributable to a particular turn of events, but were the consequence of shortcomings of the respondent State. Accordingly, the situation had to be qualified as resulting from a practice incompatible with the Convention.", "It was appropriate to apply the pilot judgment procedure, given notably the recurrent and persistent nature of the underlying problems, the number of people affected and the need to grant speedy and appropriate redress at the domestic level. Hungary was required to introduce without delay, and at the latest within one year of the judgment becoming final, a remedy or combination of remedies in the national legal system in respect of the problem of the length of civil proceedings in Hungary. Any similar new cases introduced after the judgment became final would be adjourned for one year pending implementation of the relevant measures by the respondent State.", "", "© Council of Europe/European Court of Human Rights\nThis summary by the Registry does not bind the Court.", "Click here for the "]}
