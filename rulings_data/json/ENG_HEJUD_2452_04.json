The admission of a person to a psychiatric establishment on an involuntary basis should not be construed as authorising treatment without his consent. It follows that every competent patient, whether voluntary or involuntary, should be given the opportunity to refuse treatment or any other medical intervention.

In particular, the applicant should have applied to a prosecutor who was authorised to maintain domestic legal order and consider complaints about violations of individual rights. The applicant could have lodged a complaint with a court under Article 248-1 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1963 that her fourth hospitalisation had been unlawful. The applicant could have raised the matter before the administrative courts seeking to have the actions of the hospital declared unlawful. Moreover, the applicant could have applied to court seeking damages under the Civil Code for allegedly unlawful placement in the hospital. As an alternative, the Government contended that the applicant did not comply with the six-month rule when complaining about the fourth hospitalisation as she had only raised that issue in her submissions of 18 October 2006.", "44.  The Government further maintained that the applicant had abused her right of petition by not revealing the real circumstances of her fourth hospitalisation. In particular, in her submissions the applicant concealed from the Court the fact that the fourth hospitalisation was conducted on the basis of her personal application written on 17 February 2006.", "45.  Lastly, in the Government’s opinion the part of the application referring to the fourth hospitalisation was manifestly ill-founded due to the voluntary nature of her admission to the hospital.", "46.  The applicant insisted that her complaint was admissible. She contended that she had signed the application for the fourth hospitalisation under the threat of never being discharged from the hospital. Moreover, on that day she was in particularly bad health.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "47.  The Court notes at the outset that the complaint about the first hospitalisation was submitted by the applicant to the Court on 29 May 2006 while the hospitalisation itself ended on 13 October 1999. The applicant did not raise this matter at the domestic level. The Court considers that, in view of the requirements of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, the applicant should have either made use of the domestic remedies or, in the event they were absent or ineffective, should have applied to the Court within the sixmonth time-limit from the moment when the measure complained of ceased to exist. As this has not been done, the respective part of the application should be dismissed as inadmissible.", "48.  Concerning the Government’s contention that the applicant did not comply with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies and the six-month rule when complaining of the fourth hospitalisation, the Court notes that these issues are closely connected with the merits of the complaint. The Government’s objections in this respect should therefore be joined to the merits of the application.", "49.  Concerning the issue of abuse of the right of petition, raised by the Government, such a finding may be made by the Court in exceptional circumstances, in particular, if it appears that the application was based on untrue statements in a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court (see Ismoilov and Others v. Russia, no. 2947/06, § 103, 24 April 2008). The circumstances surrounding the applicant’s fourth admission to the mental health facility did not affect other aspects of the application relating to the previous instances of the applicant’s hospitalisation in a mental health facility. Neither did they affect the applicant’s submissions to the effect that she was compulsorily kept in hospital during the fourth hospitalisation after the admission procedure had been completed. Lastly, proper regard should be given to the applicant’s further arguments as to the alleged lack of her real agreement for the fourth admission to the hospital. In sum, the applicant’s failure to initially specify the circumstances referred to by the Government did not relate to a greater part of the application, that failure cannot be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to mislead the Court and in the end it did not impede the proper conduct of the proceedings before the Court. The Government’s objection to this effect is therefore dismissed.", "50.  In the light of the material in its possession the Court considers that the applicant’s complaint under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention concerning her second, third and fourth hospitalisation in the mental health facility is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.", "B.  Merits", "1.  The parties’ submissions", "51.  The Government submitted that the case file contained sufficient evidence substantiating the need for the applicant’s second and third hospitalisation in a mental health facility. They further contended that those hospitalisations were conducted in conformity with domestic procedure, which offered appropriate procedural safeguards to comply with the requirements of lawfulness under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.", "52.  The Government further maintained their position that no issue could arise under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention with respect to the fourth hospitalisation, which had been conducted voluntarily at the applicant’s request.", "53.  The applicant argued that she had been hospitalised contrary to her right to liberty. She insisted that the courts had not examined her case properly when they ordered her second and third hospitalisations and that she had been compelled to sign an application for the fourth hospitalisation.", "2.  The Court’s assessment", "(a)  As to the second and third hospitalisations", "54.  The parties have not disputed that the applicant’s retention in a mental health facility during the second and third hospitalisations amounted to detention within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. The Court finds no reason to hold otherwise. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the impugned measures were justified under that Convention provision.", "(i)  Recapitulation of the relevant principles", "55.  The Court reiterates that an individual cannot be deprived of his liberty on the basis of unsoundness of mind unless three minimum conditions are satisfied: (i) he must reliably be shown by objective medical expertise to be of unsound mind; (ii) the mental disorder must be of a kind or degree warranting compulsory confinement; (iii) the validity of continued confinement depends upon the persistence of such a disorder (see Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, 24 October 1979, § 39, Series A no. 33 and Stanev v.  [GC], no. 36760/06, § 145, 17 January 2012).", "56.  The lawfulness of detention depends on conformity with the procedural and substantive aspects of domestic law (see Winterwerp, cited above, pp. 17-18, § 39). However, not every fault discovered in a detention order renders the underlying detention as such unlawful for the purposes of Article 5 § 1. A period of detention is, in principle, “lawful” if it is based on a court order. For the assessment of compliance with Article 5 § 1 of the Convention a basic distinction has to be made between ex facie invalid detention orders – for example, given by a court in excess of jurisdiction or where the interested party did not have proper notice of the hearing – and detention orders which are prima facie valid and effective unless and until they have been overturned by a higher court. A detention order must be considered as ex facie invalid if the flaw in the order amounted to a “gross and obvious irregularity” in the exceptional sense indicated by the Court’s case-law (see Mooren v.  [GC], no. 11364/03, §§ 74 and 75, 9 July 2009 with further references). The reasoning of the detention order is a relevant factor in determining whether a person’s detention must be considered as arbitrary. The Court has considered the absence of any grounds given by the judicial authorities in their decisions authorising detention for a prolonged period of time to be incompatible with the principle of the protection from arbitrariness enshrined in Article 5 § 1 (see Stašaitis v. Lithuania, no. 47679/99, § 67, 21 March 2002; Nakhmanovich v. Russia, no. 55669/00, § 70, 2 March 2006; and Belevitskiy v. Russia, no. 72967/01, § 91, 1 March 2007).", "57.  The detention of an individual is such a serious measure that it is only justified where other, less severe measures have been considered and found to be insufficient to safeguard the individual or public interest which might require that the person concerned be detained. That means that it does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is executed in conformity with national law, but it must also be necessary in the circumstances (see Witold Litwa v. , no. 26629/95, § 78, ECHR 2000III).", "58.  Given the importance of personal liberty, the relevant national law must meet the standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention, which requires that domestic law be sufficiently precise and foreseeable in its application (see, for example, Kawka v. Poland, no. 25874/94, § 49, 9 January 2001). Moreover, the condition that detention be “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”, requires the existence in domestic law of “fair and proper procedures” and adequate legal protection against arbitrary deprivation of liberty (see Winterwerp, cited above, pp. 19-20, § 45; Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports 1996III, pp. 851-52, § 53; and H.L. v. the United Kingdom, no. 45508/99, § 115, ECHR 2004IX).", "(ii)  Application of these principles to the present case", "59.  In the present case the need for the applicant’s second and third hospitalisations was corroborated by an individual opinion provided by a psychiatrist working at the psychoneurological dispensary, then by an individual opinion provided by a psychiatrist working at the receiving hospital, and lastly by a collective opinion of the board of psychiatrists of the same hospital (see paragraphs 7, 9, 10, 15, 17 and 18 above). The applicant’s diagnosis was therefore established and confirmed by several mental health practitioners, one of them belonging to a facility not connected, administratively or financially, with the receiving hospital. The Court accepts that in both cases there existed adequate evidence suggesting that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder which might have required her admission to the mental health facility for in-patient treatment.", "60.  Reviewing the court decisions authorising the applicant’s second and third hospitalisation, the Court notes that according to section 22 of the Psychiatric Assistance Act cases concerning compulsory provision of psychiatric assistance should be heard in the presence of the person concerned. However, there is no indication that the applicant was given any notice of the relevant hearings. The texts of the decisions do not suggest that she was present at the hearings. Neither do they suggest that the courts took any account of the applicant’s opinion as to the matters in question. No explanation was given by the courts as to why the applicant was absent and why her opinion on the appropriateness of hospitalisations was not examined.", "61.  In ordering the compulsory hospitalisations of the applicant on the grounds that she was dangerous, the courts were expected to show that the conditions for compulsory hospitalisation, as provided by section 14 of the Psychiatric Assistance Act, had been met. However, in support of their conclusions the courts did not refer to any specific facts suggesting that those conditions had been complied with. In particular, no specific facts were established in the court hearings to show that the applicant had committed or expressed a real intention to commit acts which were directly dangerous to her or to other individuals (see also Gajcsi v. Hungary, no. 34503/03, §21, 3 October 2006).", "62.  The court decisions did not refer to any other medical opinions apart from the report from the receiving mental health facility. However, assessment of the medical opinions given by mental health practitioners independently of each other would contribute to the objectivity of the medical conclusions justifying compulsory hospitalisation. In this context the Court notes that according to principle 17 § 1 of the UN Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illnesses and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care of 17 December 1991 (“the UN Principles”) the procedures for compulsory hospitalisations should provide for the independent medical assessment of the patient (see paragraph 37 above).", "63.  Assessing the court decisions from the standpoint of the necessity of the compulsory hospitalisation, the Court notes that at no point did the courts examine other, less severe, measures that might have been sufficient for the protection of the applicant’s and the public interests. In this context another question arises as to the degree of the intensity of the impugned measures. Different types and levels of mental disorders call for varying approach in selecting a regime under which a particular patient is to be kept. The courts did not address this issue, however.", "64.  The Court further notes that the above shortcomings in the court decisions could not be addressed at the stage of appeal as the courts specified that their decisions were not subject to appeal. Likewise, it has not been suggested by the Government that at the relevant time such court decisions could be challenged before the courts of appeal. Meanwhile, the availability of appeal procedure is a standard which has been recognised by the international community as essential guarantee which should exist for an involuntary patient in a mental health facility (see principle 17 § 7 of the UN Principles cited in paragraph 37 and Article 25 of the Recommendation Rec(2004)10 of the Committee of Ministers to member states concerning the protection of the human rights and dignity of persons with mental disorder (“the CM Recommendation”) cited in paragraph 38 above).", "65.  Moreover, in ordering the applicant’s hospitalisations, the domestic courts were not obliged to set any specific time-limits for those compulsory measures. In this context it is relevant to note that the CM Recommendation has endorsed the principle that the decisions to subject a person to involuntary placement in mental hospital should state the maximum period beyond which, according to law, they should be formally reviewed (see Article 20 of the CM Recommendation). The Court further notes that, according to section 17 of the Psychiatric Assistance Act, following the compulsory admission of a person to a mental hospital on the basis of judicial decision his or her mental health is subject to automatic review by a panel of psychiatrists at least once a month to determine whether it is necessary to keep the person in hospital. However, the law does not specify whether any external expert has to be involved in such examinations and does not put in place any other safeguards for the independent review of the matter. At the same time, subsequent judicial review of compulsory hospitalisation is obligatory only in cases where the hospitalisation exceeds six months. The right of the patients to apply to a court seeking review of their status comes into being only three months after the date of the court decision extending the hospitalisation.", "66.  It follows that, in the absence of any time-limits set by the courts in the primary decisions for hospitalisation, the subsequent judicial review of the matter was not available to the applicant for a considerable period of time. Meanwhile, the monthly review by a panel of psychiatrists was not supported by adequate guarantees for independence, impartiality and objectivity of the medical examination (see, mutatis mutandis, L.M. v. Latvia, no. 26000/02, § 52, 19 July 2011). Accordingly, after the compulsory admission of the applicant on the basis of the court decisions, the practitioners of the mental health facility assumed effective internal control of the applicant’s liberty and treatment for the whole period of the second hospitalisation, which lasted for two months and twenty-one days (from 28 September to 19 December 2003), and the third hospitalisation which lasted for one month and twenty days (from 19 July to 8 September 2004). The Court finds no indication that, following her admissions to the hospital, the applicant was subject to any assessment by an outside authority. Moreover, the Government did not provide any medical or other documentary evidence to show that after the admission the applicant’s status was subsequently reviewed by specialists within the hospital.", "67.  Based on the foregoing considerations the Court concludes that the applicant’s admissions to the hospital and subsequent retentions therein were not protected by appropriate safeguards against arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Moreover, it has not been reliably shown that the applicant’s retention in the hospital was justified by the mental illness throughout the whole period of her second and third hospitalisations. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention in this regard.", "(b)  As to the fourth hospitalisation", "68.  The question as to whether there was “deprivation of liberty” in respect of the fourth hospitalisation is in dispute between the parties. The Government maintained that the applicant was admitted to the hospital on the basis of her own application, which was sufficient to show that the hospitalisation was voluntary. The applicant disagreed, claiming that she was compelled to sign the admission application.", "69.  The Court reiterates that the notion of deprivation of liberty comprises both an objective element, namely a person’s confinement in a restricted space for a significant length of time, and a subjective element, namely the person’s lack of valid consent to the confinement (see Storck v. Germany, no. 61603/00, § 74, ECHR 2005V, 16 June 2005). Nevertheless, the right to liberty is too important in a democratic society for a person to lose the benefit of the protection of the Convention for the single reason that he gives himself up to be taken into detention. Detention may violate Article 5 even when the person concerned has agreed to it (see Osypenko v. , no. 4634/04, § 48, 9 November 2010).", "70.  In the present case the Court shall first examine whether the severity of the restrictions imposed on the applicant and the factual background of the case suggest that the measure in question should be qualified as deprivation of liberty; if so, then whether the applicant’s consent to hospitalisation could be viewed as valid and thus lawful for the purpose of the Convention, and lastly, whether the prolonged keeping of the applicant in the hospital was lawful.", "(i)  The nature of the measure in question", "71.  With respect to the applicant’s stay in the hospital, the Court notes that if in-patient psychiatric treatment is voluntary this presupposes that the patient has the guaranteed right to stop any further treatment and to leave the hospital whenever he or she wishes to do so. This freedom of action is subject to mental health practitioners’ authority to refuse to discharge the patient, provided that the relevant compulsory admission procedures are immediately applied, following which the person shall be treated as an involuntary patient. This approach is recognised both internationally (see principle 15 of the UN Principles cited in paragraph 37 above) and at the domestic level (see section 18 of the Psychiatric Assistance Act cited in paragraph 35).", "72.  However, there is no indication that after being admitted the applicant was free to leave the hospital. The applicant contended that she was confined in the hospital in quite strict conditions, even as to freedom of movement within the premises of the hospital, let alone freedom to leave the hospital. The control over her liberty and privacy extended to strict limitations on her personal belongings. The applicant’s account of the factual situation is indirectly corroborated by the CPT’s observations expressed after the visit to a similar mental health facility in . The CPT noted that a large number of adult patients, who had not been officially admitted as involuntary patients, could not in fact leave the hospital of their own free will (see paragraph 40 above).", "73.  At the same time the applicant’s submissions have not been shown by the Government to be false in any way. No evidence has been provided by the Government as to the regime of the applicant’s stay in the hospital specifying, in particular, what difference there was between the applicant’s daily supervision and that of involuntary patients, the amount of social contact allowed, the restrictions on privacy and other matters of fact. These matters were in the possession of the authorities rather than of the applicant.", "74.  Therefore the Court, having regard to the overall context of the case, must give preference to the applicant’s account of the facts and conclude that after the admission the applicant was deprived of liberty throughout the period of the fourth hospitalisation, within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.", "(ii)  The consent to admission", "75.  With respect to the applicant’s consent to admission, the Court considers that medical practitioners are required to pay particular attention to the validity of decisions made by a person whose mental health is questionable.", "76.  The international community has developed a set of relevant principles under which the validity of a patient’s consent to psychiatric treatment can be ensured. In particular, under principle 11 § 2 of the UN Principles an agreement to psychiatric treatment implies that a patient has been provided with adequate and understandable information, in a form and language he or she understands on the diagnostic assessment; the purpose, method, likely duration and expected benefit of the proposed treatment; alternative modes of treatment, including those less intrusive; possible pain or discomfort, risks and side-effects of the proposed treatment (see paragraph 37 above). The CPT has specified that consent to treatment can only be qualified as free and informed if it is based on full, accurate and comprehensible information about the patient’s condition and the treatment proposed (see paragraph 39 above).", "77.   Accordingly, the Court takes the view that a person’s consent to admission to a mental health facility for in-patient treatment can be regarded as valid for the purpose of the Convention only where there is sufficient and reliable evidence suggesting that the person’s mental ability to consent and comprehend the consequences thereof has been objectively established in the course of a fair and proper procedure and that all the necessary information concerning placement and intended treatment has been adequately provided to him.", "78.  In the present case the applicant’s hospitalisation was conducted on the basis of the consent given by the applicant who, at the relevant time, had been diagnosed with a mental disorder. The only document evidencing the applicant’s consent is her admission application. While section 13 of the Psychiatric Assistance Act requires that consent to hospitalisation should be signed by the person concerned and a psychiatrist, no such consent countersigned by a psychiatrist has been presented to the Court. There is no evidence suggesting that her mental ability to consent was established, that the consequences of the consent were explained to her or that the relevant information on placement and treatment was provided to her.", "79.  In these circumstances the Court considers that the applicant’s consent to the fourth hospitalisation cannot be viewed as valid and lawful for the purpose of the Convention.", "(iii)  The lawfulness of keeping the applicant in the hospital", "80.  In determining whether keeping the applicant in the hospital could be justified on the grounds of her mental health, the Court notes that the only medical evidence available in the case file with respect to this period is a copy of a psychiatrist’s opinion of 13 February 2006 preceding the applicant’s admission to the hospital. However, there is no evidence suggesting that the applicant’s mental illness continued to persist throughout the period of the fourth hospitalisation, which lasted from 17 February to 19 April 2006, that is for two months. In these circumstances the Court is unable to conclude that keeping the applicant in the hospital was justified for that period.", "81.  The Court further reiterates that the requirements of appropriate procedural safeguards against arbitrary retention in a mental health facility are inherent in the concept of lawfulness under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. This issue is equally important with respect to voluntary patients, because without safeguards for this type of patient, there may be improper inducements to circumvent the complicated procedure for compulsory hospitalisation by admitting a person on a “voluntary” basis. As a result, the guarantees provided within a compulsory hospitalisation may lose their practical efficiency and not serve as a real shield against arbitrary deprivation of liberty.", "82.  The Court has noted above that the applicant’s admission to the hospital was not supported by the necessary safeguards ensuring the validity of her consent to admission. As regards keeping the applicant in the hospital, no information has been provided by the Government as to the existing practice of regular visits to mental health facilities by an independent outside body with the aim of talking privately with patients, reviewing their status on its own initiative, receiving complaints, and dealing effectively with the issues raised by the patients. The importance of such supervisory procedures has been stressed by the CPT (see paragraph 39 above). In the Court’s opinion the availability of these procedures offering independent review of the status of both voluntary and involuntary admitted patients are essential guarantees against possible abuses in their respect.", "83.  Considering further the issues of legal procedures, the Court cannot find that the remedies referred to by the Government in their objections as to the admissibility of the instant complaint on the grounds of nonexhaustion were effective for the purposes of the Convention. In the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies there is a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the Government claiming nonexhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant’s complaints, and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996IV). Having regard to the vulnerability of persons placed in mental health facilities, the Court considers that it was the Government’s onus probandi to show that the remedies, they mentioned, were effective.", "84.  One of the principal issues in examining the effectiveness of a remedy is whether it could offer adequate redress. The Court would not exclude that certain complaints concerning deprivation of liberty may be adequately redressed by retrospective remedies. For example, complaints about short periods of detention or certain kinds of non-compliance with the formalities of the domestic law in exercising detention procedures may be (and, in some circumstances, may exclusively be) adequately protected by recourse to a retrospective remedy. However, where the complaint is about a continued and arbitrary deprivation of liberty conducted in the absence of a fair and proper procedure for admission to the facility, as in the present case, an adequate remedy is primarily one capable of immediately terminating the continued violation by ordering release. The specific requirements of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention concerning the judicial character of a necessary procedure, including guarantees of independent and impartial review based on the adversarial nature of the procedure and the principle of equality of arms, are inherent in such a remedy. A retrospective compensatory relief could be supplementary to that remedy.", "85.  As regards the complaint to the prosecutor referred to by the Government, this recourse cannot be regarded as an adequate remedy because of the lack of the above-mentioned procedural safeguards. Besides that, the Government have not provided any comparable examples of domestic practice where the prosecutors had offered adequate redress in an appropriate manner. The Court would reiterate that the remedy should offer direct and timely redress, and not merely indirect protection of the rights guaranteed by the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Melnik v. , no. 72286/01, § 68, 28 March 2006).", "86.  The Government’s argument that the applicant could have complained to a court under Article 248-1 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1963 is immaterial, as that Code was no longer in force at the relevant time (see paragraph 33). As to the action in an administrative court, the Government have not provided any substantiation or any examples of domestic practice showing that such an action would have had any prospect of success, given that the jurisdiction of administrative courts covers only public-law disputes involving public authorities (see paragraph 34). Civil proceedings for damages under the Civil Code constitutes a purely compensatory remedy and, for the reasons set out in paragraph 84 above, would not offer appropriate protection in respect of the applicant’s complaint.", "87.  Moreover, assessing the effectiveness of these remedies from the standpoint of their practical availability, the Court, having regard to the applicant’s submissions as to the regime under which she was kept in the hospital, notes that no evidence has been provided suggesting that any appropriate mailing service or other means of communication with the outer world, protected by specific and practical safeguards ensuring the privacy of communication, existed in the hospital. Nor has it been shown that any legal aid schemes were available to the applicant to support her complaints and ensure that her interests were represented. As noted above, no information has been provided concerning any practice of visits to the hospital by outside authorities with the purpose of communication with the patients. The CPT’s critical observations as to the practical availability of the legal safeguards for the patients of a similar mental health facility are quite pertinent in this context (see paragraph 40 above).", "88.  In the light of these considerations the Court rejects the Government’s contention concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.", "89.  It further notes that the present complaint was submitted to the Court on 7 October 2006 and the applicant was discharged from the hospital on 19 April 2006. The complaint was therefore lodged within six months of the moment when the continuing situation complained of ceased to exist (see, among other authorities, Papon v. France (no. 1) (dec.), no. 64666/01, ECHR 2001-VI). Accordingly, the Government’s objections as to the sixmonth rule should also be dismissed.", "(iv)  Conclusion", "90.  The Court therefore concludes that it has not been reliably shown that the applicant’s retention in the hospital was justified by the mental illness throughout the period of her fourth hospitalisation; moreover, her admission to the hospital and retention therein were not supported by adequate procedural safeguards against arbitrary deprivation of liberty. There has therefore been a violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention in this respect.", "II.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 § 5 OF THE CONVENTION", "91.  In her initial submissions the applicant complained of a violation of her right provided by Article 5 § 5 of the Convention.", "92.  However, the applicant did not pursue this complaint further. In particular, she made no submissions to this effect at the stage of communicating the application to the Government. It appears that this issue did not constitute a matter of concern for her.", "93.  In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant may not be regarded as wishing to pursue the complaint under Article 5 § 5 of the Convention, within the meaning of Article 37 § 1 (a) of the Convention (see Nikolay Kucherenko v. , no. 16447/04, §§ 39-41, 19 February 2009 and Visloguzov v. , no. 32362/02, §§ 98-100, 20 May 2010). Furthermore, in accordance with Article 37 § 1 in fine, the Court finds no special circumstances regarding respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols which require the continued consideration of the complaint. In view of the above, the Court finds it appropriate to discontinue the examination of this part of the application.", "III.  OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION", "94.  The applicant complained of violations of Articles 3, 9, 10 and 14 of the Convention on account of her compulsory stays in the hospital. She further complained under Articles 4 and 6 of the Convention that the proceedings in her labour dispute were unfair.", "95.  The Court has examined those complaints and considers that, in the light of all the material in its possession and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. Accordingly, the Court rejects them as manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.", "IV.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION", "96.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "A.  Damage", "97.  The applicant claimed pecuniary damage without specifying the amount. She further claimed 4,000,000 euros (EUR) in respect of nonpecuniary damage.", "98.  The Government submitted that the claims were excessive and groundless.", "99.  The Court notes that the applicant failed to substantiate the pecuniary damage incurred. It therefore makes no award in this respect. As to non-pecuniary damage, the Court considers that the applicant must have suffered distress and anxiety on account of the violations found. Ruling on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, it awards the applicant EUR 12,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.", "B.  Costs and expenses", "100.  The applicant also claimed compensation for costs and expenses incurred before the domestic authorities and the Court, without specifying the amount.", "101.  The Government maintained that the claim was unsubstantiated.", "102.  In the present case, no evidence has been presented within the timelimit fixed concerning the costs and expenses claimed. The Court therefore rejects the claim.", "C.  Default interest", "103.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.", "FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY", "1.  Decides to discontinue the examination of the applicant’s complaint of an alleged violation of Article 5 § 5 of the Convention;", "", "2.  Joins to the merits the Government’s objections as to the applicant’s compliance with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies and the six-month rule and dismisses them after an examination on the merits;", "", "3.  Declares the complaint under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention (concerning the second, third and fourth hospitalisations in a mental health facility) admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;", "", "4.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention as regards the second, third and fourth hospitalisations of the applicant in a mental health facility;", "", "5.  Holds", "(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 12,000 (twelve thousand euros) plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;", "(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;", "", "6.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.", "Done in English, and notified in writing on 19 April 2012, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.", "\tClaudia Westerdiek\tDean Spielmann\n\tRegistrar\tPresident"]}
